<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>To treat her as a goddess has always been accounted a sure way of
winning a lady’s favour. To the cynic, therefore, it might seem
that Mrs. McGovern was bound to speak well of her head-hunting friends
of the Formosan hills, seeing that they welcomed her with a respect
that bordered on veneration. But of other head-hunters, hailing, say,
from Borneo or from Assam, anthropologists have reported no less well,
and that though the investigators were accorded no divine honours.
The key to a just estimate of savage morality is knowledge of all the
conditions. A custom that considered in itself is decidedly revolting
may, on further acquaintance with the state of culture as a whole, turn
out to be, if not praiseworthy, at least a drawback incidental to a
normal phase of the ruder life of mankind.</p>

<p>The “grizzled warrior,” we are told, who made oblation
to our authoress, bore on his chin the honourable mark of the
man-slayer. To her Chinese coolie that formidable badge would have been
enough to proclaim the wearer <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>&mdash;the kind of wicked animal
that defends itself when attacked. Thus, if it merely served to warn
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
invading alien to keep his distance, this crude advertisement of
a head-hunting habit would be justified, from the standpoint of
the survival of the hard-pressed aborigines. Even had a threat of
cannibalism been thrown in, its protective value could hardly be
denied; for, much as men object to be killed, they commonly deem it
worse to be killed and eaten. Though reputed to be man-eaters, however,
the savages of Formosa are not so in fact. Indeed, the boot is on the
other foot. I remember Mr. Shinji Ishii telling us at a meeting of
the Folk-lore Society that, despite their claim to a higher form of
civilization, the Chinese of the adjoining districts will occasionally
partake of a head-hunter, chopped up small and disguised in soup: the
principle implied in the precaution being, I dare say, sound enough,
namely, that of inoculation, though doubtless the application is
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, head-hunting has for these wild-folk a function and
significance that are not to be understood so long as we consider it
as a thing apart. The same canon of interpretation holds good of any
other outstanding feature of the social life. Customs are the organic
parts of a body of custom. To use a technical expression, they are but
so many elements composing a single “culture-complex.”
Modern research is greatly concerned with the tracing out of
resemblances due to the spread of one or another system of associated
customs. The method is to try to work back to some ethnic centre
of diffusion; where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> characteristic elements of the system,
whatever might have been their remoter derivation, have been thoroughly
fused together, in the course of a long process of adaptation to a
given environment. Thereupon it becomes possible to follow up the
propagation of influence as it radiates from this centre in various
directions outwards. Now it may well be that the tradition rarely, or
never, is imparted in its entirety. Selection, or sheer accident, will
cause not a little to be left behind. On the other hand, the chances
are all against one custom setting forth by itself. Customs tend to
emigrate in groups. Thus head-hunting, and a certain mode of tattooing,
and the institution of the skull-shelf, and the requirement that a
would-be husband must display a head as token of his prowess, are on
the face of them associated customs, and such as are suited to have
been travelling companions. Hence it is for the ethnologist to see
whether he cannot refer the whole assortment to some intrusive culture
of Indonesian or other origin.</p>

<p>Yet lest one good method should corrupt the science, we should not
forget that there is another side to the study of culture; though
from this side likewise there is equal need to examine customs, not
apart, but in their organic connexion with each other. Whencesoever
derived, the customs of a people have an ascertainable worth here
and now for those who live by them. The first business, I should
even venture to say, of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> anthropologist, be his sphere the study or
the field, is to seek to appreciate a given culture as the expression
of a scheme of values. Every culture represents a set of means whereby
it is sought to realize a mode of life. Unconsciously for the most
part, yet none the less actually, every human society pursues an ideal.
To grasp this ideal is to possess the clue to the whole cultural
process as a spiritual and vital movement. The social inheritance is
subject to a constant revaluation, bringing readaptation in its train.
There is a selective activity at work, and to apprehend its secret
springs one must keep asking all the time, what does this people want,
and want most? unconscious though it may largely be, the want is
there. Correspondingly, since it is a question of getting into touch
with a latent process, the anthropologist must employ a method which
I can only describe as one of divination. He must somehow enter into
the soul of a people. Introjection, or in plainer language sympathy,
is the master-key. Objective methods so-called are all very well; but
if, as sometimes happens, they lead one to forget that anthropology
is ultimately the science of the inner man, then they but batter at a
closed door.</p>

<p>A sure criterion, then, by which to appraise any account of a
savage people consists in the measure of the sympathy shown. A summary
sketch that has this saving quality will be found more illuminating
than many volumes of statistics. Literally<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> or otherwise, the student
of wild-folk must have undergone initiation at their hands. Having
become as one of themselves, he is qualified to act as their spokesman,
putting into such words as we can understand the felt needs and
aspirations of a less self-conscious type of humanity. Here, for
instance, Mrs. McGovern, though writing for the general public, and
reserving a full digest of her material for another work, has sought to
present an insider’s version of the aboriginal life of Formosa.
She was willing to become an initiate, and did in fact become so,
almost overshooting the mark, as it were, through translation to a
super-human plane. So throughout she tries to do justice to the native
point of view. She says enough to make us feel that, despite certain
notions more or less offensive to our conscience, the ideal of the
Formosan tribesman is in important respects quite admirable. He is on
the whole a good man according to his lights. Allowance being made for
his handicap, he is playing the game of life as well as he can.</p>

<p>Having thus dealt briefly with principles of interpretation I
perhaps ought to stop short, since an anthropologist as such has
nothing to do with the bearing of his science on questions of political
administration. Mrs. McGovern, however, has a good deal to say about
the means whereby it is proposed to convert head-hunters into peaceable
and useful citizens. Without going into the facts, upon which I am
incompetent to throw any fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> light, I might venture to make some
observations of a general nature that depend on a principle already
mentioned. This principle was, that to understand a people is to
envisage its ideal. The practical corollary, I suggest, is that, to
preserve a people, one must preserve its ideal so far as to leave its
vital and vitalizing elements intact. In other words, in purging that
ideal, as may be done and ought to be done when it is sought to lift
a backward people out of savagery, great care should be taken not to
wreck their whole scheme of values, to cause all that has hitherto made
life worth living for them to seem cheap and futile. Given sympathetic
insight into their dream of the good life&mdash;one that is, probably,
not unlike ours in its main essentials&mdash;it ought to prove feasible
to curtail noxious practices by substituting better ways of satisfying
the same needs. Contact with civilization is apt to produce among
savages a paralysis of the will to live. More die of depression than
of disease or drink. They lose their interest in existence. Their
spirit is broken. When the policy is to preserve them, the mere man of
science can lend a hand by pointing out what indeed every experienced
administrator knows by the time he has bought his experience at other
people’s expense. Given, then, the insider’s point of view,
a sense of what the savage people itself wants and is trying for,
and given also patience in abundance, civilization may effectively
undertake to fulfil, instead of destroying.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><cite>Among the Head-hunters of Formosa</cite> contains the substance of
observations made during a two-years’ stay in Formosa&mdash;from
September 1916 to September 1918. The book is written for the general
reader, rather than for the specialist in anthropology or ethnology.
Hence many details&mdash;especially those concerning minor differences
in manners and customs among the various aboriginal tribes&mdash;have
been omitted; for these, while perhaps of interest to the specialist,
would prove wearying to the layman.</p>

<p>Inadequate as the treatment of the subject may seem to the
anthropologist, I venture to hope that such information as the book
contains may stimulate interest, and perhaps encourage further
investigation, before it is too late, into the tribal customs and
habits of a little-known, and rapidly disappearing, people.</p>

<p>A writer&mdash;signing himself “P. M.”&mdash;discussing
the aborigines of Formosa, in the <cite>China Review</cite> (vol. ii) for 1873,
says: “Decay and death are always sad sights to contemplate,
and when decay and death are those of a nation or race, the feeling
is stimulated to acuteness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>”</p>

<p>If this feeling in connection with the aborigines was aroused in
a European resident in Formosa in 1873, how much more strongly is
this the case to-day&mdash;nearly half a century later&mdash;when the
aboriginal population has dwindled from approximately one-sixth of the
population of the island (an estimate given by Keane in his remarks on
Formosa, in <cite>Man Past and Present</cite>) to about 3 per cent. of the entire
population&mdash;a decline of 15 per cent. in less than fifty years.
Under the present system of “benevolent assimilation” on
the part of the Japanese Government the aboriginal population seems
declining at an even more rapid rate than it did under Chinese rule,
which ended in 1895. Hence if the mistake which was made in the case of
the Tasmanians&mdash;that of allowing them to die out before definite
or detailed information regarding their beliefs and customs was
gained&mdash;is to be avoided in the case of the Formosan aborigines,
all anthropological data available, both social and physical, should be
gained without further delay. Up to this time apparently but little has
been done in the way of scientific study of these people, in spite of
the fact that, as Keane points out, Formosa “presents a curious
ethnical and linguistic connecting link between the continental and
oceanic populations of Asia.”</p>

<p>Dr. W. Campbell, writing in <cite>Hastings’ Encyclop&aelig;dia
of Religion and Ethics</cite> (vol. vi) remarks: “The first thing to
notice in making any statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> about the savages of Formosa is the
extreme paucity of information which is available.” If anything
which I&mdash;the first white woman to go among certain of the tribal
groups of these savages&mdash;am able to say will make less this
“extreme paucity of information,” then I shall feel that
the time spent in writing this book has not been wasted.</p>

<p>I must add that I am deeply indebted to Dr. Marett, of Oxford, who
most kindly read the greater part of the book in manuscript form; and
again in proof.</p>

<p class="p2 ph4">NOTE</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among other valuable suggestions, Dr. Marett has called my attention
to the fact that the word “caribou” (sometimes spelt
carabao) is used in this book to describe an animal other than the
American reindeer. It is quite true that no dictionary would define
“caribou” as meaning the hideous, almost hairless, beast of
the bovine species used in certain parts of Indonesia for ploughing the
rice-paddies, and whose favourite recreation&mdash;when not harnessed
to the plough&mdash;is to lie, or to stand, buried to its neck in
muddy water; yet this beast is so called both in the Philippines
and in Formosa; that is, by English and Americans resident in these
islands. By the Japanese the animal is called <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sui-gyu</i>; by the
Chinese <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">shui-niu</i> (as nearly as the sound can be imitated in English
spelling); the characters being the same in both languages, but the
pronunciation different.</p>

<p>In connection with the pronunciation and the English<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> spelling
of Chinese and Japanese words, the spelling is of course phonetic. This
applies to the names of places, as well as to other words. As regards
Formosan place names, the difficulty of adequate transliteration is
aggravated by the fact that the Chinese-Formosans and the Japanese,
while using the same written characters, pronounce the names quite
differently. In spelling the names of places, I have followed that
system usually adopted in English books. There can, however, be no
hard and fast rules for Sino-Japanese spelling; therefore the Japanese
gentleman to whom I am indebted for the map who has spelled Keelung
with a single “e,” is quite “within his rights”
from the point of view of transliteration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">IMPRESSIONS FROM A DISTANCE</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>Scepticism regarding the Existence of a Matriarchate&mdash;Glimpse
of Formosa from a Steamer’s Deck in passing&mdash;Hearsay in
Japan concerning the Island Colony&mdash;Opportunity of going to
Formosa as a Government Official.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the actual existence of
matriarchates I had always been sceptical. Matrilineal tribes, and
those matrilocal&mdash;that was a different matter. The existence of
these among certain primitive peoples had long been substantiated.
But that the name should descend in the line of the mother, or
that the newly married couple should take up its residence in
the tribe or phratry of the bride, has not of necessity meant
that the woman held the reins of power. Quite the reverse in many
cases, as actual contact with peoples among whom matrilineal and
matrilocal customs existed has proved to every practical observer.<a
name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Those lecturers in the “Woman’s Cause” who<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
boasted of the “great matriarchates of old” I thought
weakened, rather than strengthened, the cause they would advocate by
attempting to bring to its aid evidence builded on the sands. The great
“matriarchates of antiquity” I was inclined to class with
the “Golden Age” of the Theosophists, as representing a
state of affairs not only “too good to be true,” but one in
which the wish was&mdash;to paraphrase&mdash;father to the belief. And
as to prehistoric matriarchates, representing a highly evolved state
of civilization&mdash;in anything like the present-day significance of
that word&mdash;I am still sceptical; as sceptical as I am of a Golden
Age preceding the day of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pithecanthropus</i> and his kind.</p>

<p>But a land which is, as regards its aboriginal inhabitants&mdash;now
confined to a few tribes, and those fast diminishing, in its more
mountainous and inaccessible portions&mdash;sufficiently matripotestal
to justify its being called a matriarchate, I have found. And this,
as is often the case with a quest of any sort, rather by accident.
Residence among the American Indians of New Mexico, of Arizona,
and of Nevada, and a slight knowledge of the natives of certain of
the Pacific Islands&mdash;particularly those of Hawaii and of the
Philippines&mdash;had led me to give up the idea of finding a genuine
matriarchate even among primitive peoples. Too often I had found
that where those who had “passed by” had spoken of a
“matriarchal state” as existing, investigation had proved
one that was only matrilineal or matrilocal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in Formosa that I found these matriarchal people; Formosa,
that little-known island in the typhoon-infested South China Sea,
so well called by its early Portuguese discoverers&mdash;as its
name implies&mdash;“the beautiful.” Indeed, it was the
beauty of Formosa that first attracted me. I shall never forget the
first glimpse that I caught of the island as I passed it, going by
steamer from Manila<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to Nagasaki. There it
lay, in the light of the tropical sunrise, glowing and shimmering
like a great emerald, with an apparent vividness of green that I had
never seen before, even in the tropics. During the greater part of the
day it remained in sight, apparently floating slowly past&mdash;an
emerald on a turquoise bed. For on that day there was no typhoon or
threat of typhoon, and on such a day the China Sea can, with its
wonderful blueness and calm, make amends for the many other days on
which, like the raging dragon that the Chinese peasants believe it
veritably to be, of murky green, spitting white foam, deck-high, it
threatens&mdash;and often brings&mdash;death and destruction to those
who venture upon it. Nor was the emerald island a jewel in the rough.
The Chinese call it Taiwan, a name which means, in the characters
of their language, Terrace Beach, <a href="images/i_031fs.png"><img
src="images/i_031.png" alt="Chinese character" /></a>.<a
name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This name<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> the Japanese&mdash;the
present masters of the Island&mdash;have adopted; and it is not
an inappropriate one. Nor do the terraces refer to those small,
low-lying ones of the rice-paddies which for some centuries Chinese
coolies have cultivated on the fertile east coast of the island;
but rather to those bolder mountain terraces, carved by the hand of
Nature, and covered with that wild verdure which only tropical rains,
followed by tropical sunshine, can produce.<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
These terraces&mdash;gleaming brilliant green, and seeming to refract
the sunlight of that April day, as we sailed across the Tropic of
Cancer, which cuts Formosa through the middle&mdash;were curiously like
the facets of a great emerald, polished and carefully cut.</p>

<p>The glimpse which I caught that day of the shining island with its
vivid colouring, and seemingly wondrously carved surface, remained
with me as a pleasant memory during the several years that I spent in
Japan.</p>

<p>Although Formosa is now a Japanese colony&mdash;has been since
1895&mdash;one is able to get curiously little definite information
in Japan regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> island. From the Japanese themselves
one hears only of the marvellous energy and skill of the Japanese
in exploiting the resources of the island&mdash;sugar, camphor,
tea&mdash;and the manufacture of opium, a Government monopoly. From
the English, Scottish, and Canadian missionaries stationed in Formosa,
who sometimes spend their summers in Japan, one hears more of the
exploiting, on the part of the Japanese, of the Chinese population of
Formosa&mdash;a fact which later I found to be cruelly true.</p>

<p>Now and then, while I was in Japan, I heard vague rumours of
head-hunting aboriginal tribes in the mountains of Formosa, but
regarding these I could gain little exact information. The Japanese,
when questioned about the aborigines, were either curiously
uncommunicative, or else launched at once into panegyrics concerning
the nobility of the Japanese authorities in Formosa in allowing dirty,
head-hunting savages to live, especially as some of these dirty
head-hunters had dared to rebel against the Japanese Government of
the island. Of the manners and customs of the aborigines, however,
the Japanese seemed wholly ignorant. Nor were the missionaries
from Formosa much better informed, as far as the aborigines were
concerned. Their mission work, they said, was confined to the Chinese
population of the island, with now and then tactful attempts at the
conversion of the Japanese. But as for the aboriginal tribes&mdash;yes,
they believed there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> were such people in the mountains; one
of their number, when going from one Chinese village to another
in the interior of the island, had seen a queen or “heathen
priestess” of the aborigines carried on the shoulders of her
followers. More they did not know&mdash;yes, probably it was true that
these savages cut off people’s heads whenever they had a chance.
They were heathen&mdash;what could one expect?...</p>

<p>While failing to get much accurate information regarding the
aborigines of Formosa, I managed, on the other hand, to get a good
deal of misinformation. One book in particular, I remember, written
obviously by one who had never been there, gave the impression that the
whole island was inhabited by savages, with a “small sprinkling
at the ports of Japanese, Chinese, English, and Filipinos.”</p>

<p>The most trustworthy information concerning Formosa&mdash;as I
later learned, after I myself had been to the island&mdash;was that
obtained through the columns of the <cite>Japan Chronicle</cite>, an English
newspaper published in Kobe. This information was in connection,
particularly, with “reprisal-measures” of extraordinary
severity taken by the Japanese Government of Formosa against certain
of the aboriginal tribes, some members of which had risen in revolt
against the Japanese gendarmerie (<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Aiyu-sen</i>) placed in authority over
them. This curiously cruel strain in the Japanese character was at
that time difficult for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> believe<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
(I had not then been in Korea, or in any of the other Japanese
dependencies). But what was said of the Formosan aborigines aroused
my interest to such an extent that I was anxious to study them at
first-hand.</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, prevented my going to Formosa for some time.
A “foreigner”&mdash;American or European&mdash;anywhere
in the Japanese Empire is always more or less under surveillance; in
the colonies&mdash;Formosa and Korea&mdash;more rather than less.
Any attempt to go to Formosa to carry out independent investigation
of the aborigines would, I knew, have been politely thwarted by the
Japanese authorities. A “personally conducted tour”
could, finances permitting, have easily been arranged. I would have
been most politely received by the Japanese officials of the island,
and escorted by them to those places which they wished me to see,
and introduced to those people whom they wished me to meet. Such
had been the experience of several “foreigners” who had
gone to visit the island and “study its people.” To live
for any length of time in Formosa one must satisfy the Japanese
authorities that definite business demands one’s presence
there. At that time I had no “definite business which demanded
my presence” in Formosa. Nor had a “bradyaga”<a
name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> like myself the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> capital to start a business
in tea or sugar, which would have given a credible excuse for living
in the island. Besides, a <em>woman</em> tea-exporter!&mdash;the Japanese
authorities would scarcely have been satisfied.</p>

<p>My desire to learn at first-hand something of the aborigines of
Formosa remained, therefore, more or less an inchoate inclination
on my part, and I turned my attention to other things. Then,
curiously enough, as coincidences always seem curious when they
affect ourselves, a few months later, when I was in Kyoto, studying
Mahayana Buddhism,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> came an offer from a
Japanese official to go to Formosa as a teacher of English in the
Japanese Government School in Taihoku, the capital of the island.<a

class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;and I knew that however Japanese people
in different parts of the empire might vary in other respects, on
one point, at least, they were singularly alike; that is, in their
incapacity for the ready assimilation of a European tongue. This
in rather curious contrast to their ability for imitation in other
respects. No; teaching English to Japanese was no sinecure. But it
opened for me the way to go to Formosa; it gave me an “excuse
for being,” as far as existence on that island was concerned.
Consequently I accepted the offer to teach in the school which
had been built for the sons of Japanese officials in Formosa,<a
name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and in September 1916 I sailed from Kobe,
Japan, for Keelung, the northernmost port of Formosa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Formosa</span> lies about a thousand miles south
of Kobe&mdash;six hundred and sixty miles, it is estimated, south
of Kagoshima, the southernmost point of Japan proper&mdash;and the
voyage of four days down through the Tung Hai (Eastern China Sea) was
a warm one, the latter part especially. Before Keelung was reached,
the wraps that had been comfortable when leaving Japan were discarded
in favour of the thinnest clothing that could be unpacked from bags or
steamer-trunk. Two Scottish missionaries, returning to their work among
the Chinese-Formosan in the southern part of the island, were the only
other foreigners<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (white people)
on board. The other passengers&mdash;certainly of first and
second class&mdash;were, with one exception, Japanese; chiefly
Japanese officials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> who, with their families, were going to
take up their duties in the island colony of the empire; or to resume
these duties after a summer vacation spent in Japan. The one exception
was&mdash;as exceptions usually are&mdash;the most interesting person
on board. This was a Chinese-Formosan; one who, in the days before
the Japanese possession, had belonged to one of the “old”
families of the island&mdash;as people all over the world are
accustomed to reckon age in connection with “family”
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fond</i>, how curiously alike are we all&mdash;Oriental and
Occidental&mdash;in the little snobbishnesses that make up the sum of
human pride&mdash;and human childishness).</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption">GATEWAY OF THE OLD CHINESE WALL</p>
  <p class="caption"><i>Formerly surrounding the city of Taihoku, the
capital of Formosa.</i></p>
</div>

<p>At any rate, in the days when “old” families in
Formosa meant also wealthy families, this Chinese-Formosan, then
young, had been sent to Hongkong, to be educated in an English
college there. Consequently it was in excellent English that he
told me something both of the early history of Formosa, as this had
been recorded in old Chinese manuscripts, and also something of the
traditions of the Chinese peasantry regarding the origin of the
island. This&mdash;the origin&mdash;was connected, as are almost all
things else in China, in the minds of the people, with the dragon.
It seems that, according to popular legend&mdash;which the early
Chinese geographers repeated in all seriousness&mdash;the particular
dragon which was responsible for the origin of Formosa was one of
more than usual ferocity. The home of this<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> prince among dragons was
Woo-hoo-mun (Five Tiger Gate), which lies at the entrance of Foochow,
a town on the South China coast. One day his dragonship, being in a
frolicsome mood, went for a day’s sport in the depths of the
ocean. In his play he brought up from the ocean-bed sufficient earth
to mould into a semblance of himself; Keelung being the head; the
long, narrow peninsula, ending in Cape Garanbi, the southernmost
point of the island, being the tail; the great mountain-range running
from north to south&mdash;of which Mt. Sylvia and Mt. Morrison<a
name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are the two highest peaks&mdash;representing
the bristling spines on the back of the dragon.</p>

<p>Thus according to tradition was created the island of Formosa,
or Taiwan, which is in area about half the size of Scotland,
but is in shape long and narrow, being about 265 miles long<a
name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and&mdash;at its widest point&mdash;about
80 miles wide. It is separated from China by the Formosa Channel,
sometimes called Fokien Strait, which is at the widest about 245 miles,
but at the narrowest only 62 miles; the dragon seeming to prefer to
build this memorial of himself almost within sight of his permanent
abiding-place. Indeed the Chinese-Formosan fishermen declare<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> that
on a clear day the coast-line of China may be discerned from the
west coast of Formosa. But this I, myself, have never seen&mdash;the
curve of the earth, alone, would, I think, prevent its being actually
seen&mdash;and I am inclined to think that the fishermen mistake the
outline of the Pescadores, small islands lying between China and
Formosa, but nearer the latter, for China proper. That is, if their
imagination does not play them false altogether, and build for them out
of the clouds on the horizon a semblance of the coast-line of the home
of their ancestors&mdash;something sacred to every Chinese, whatever
the conditions of starvation or servitude which drove his ancestors
from the motherland.</p>

<p>Something of the early historical, or pseudo-historical, records
of Formosa my Chinese-Formosan fellow-voyager on the Osaka Shosen
Kaisha steamer also told me. It seems that the first mention in
Chinese records of the island is in the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Sui-Shu</i>&mdash;the history
of the Sui Dynasty, which lasted from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
581 to 618, according to Occidental reckoning. At that time Chinese
historians and also geographers believed Formosa to be one of the
Lu-chu (<a href="images/i_043fs.png"><img src="images/i_043.png"
alt="Chinese characters" /></a>) group; that long chain of tiny islands
which dot the sea from the south of Japan to the north of Formosa,
like stepping-stones, or&mdash;as they more strongly reminded me when
I first saw them&mdash;like the stones which Hop-o’-my-Thumb
dropped from his pocket when he and his brothers were carried<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> away
into the forest, that they might find their way back home.</p>

<p>According to early Chinese historians the aboriginal inhabitants of
Formosa up to about the sixth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
were a gentle and peaceable people, making no objection to Chinese
settlements on the coast of the island. Then in about the second
half of the sixth century&mdash;as nearly as Oriental and Occidental
systems of reckoning time can be correlated (the beginning of the Sui
dynasty) there swept up from “somewhere in the south” bands
of fierce marauders who conquered the west coast of the island and
drove the surviving aboriginal inhabitants into the central mountains.
A little later&mdash;in about the seventh century&mdash;the Chinese
historian, Ma Tuan-hiu, says a Chinese expedition went to Formosa,
with the intention of forcing the new inhabitants to pay tribute to
China. This, however, these “new inhabitants”&mdash;of
Malay origin presumably&mdash;refused to do. Consequently great
numbers were killed by the Chinese, who also burned many native
villages, and used the blood of the slain inhabitants for caulking
their boats. To one who knows the peculiar reverence with which
blood is regarded by all primitive peoples, and the many ceremonies,
religious and social, in which the use of blood makes the ceremony
sacred, it is easily comprehensible that the caulking of Chinese boats
with the blood of their kinsmen caused greater consternation among
the Formosan savages than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> mere slaughter of a greater number of
their people would have done.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the ruthless measures taken by the Chinese
in their efforts to extort tribute, the “wild men of the
South” held their ground, and the Chinese were at last obliged
to leave the island without tribute, and without having exacted the
promise of it. This, according to Chinese records, was an unprecedented
occurrence when sons of the Flowery Kingdom were dealing with
barbarians.</p>

<p>For several centuries Chinese records seem to have made little or no
mention of Formosa; then in the twelfth century occurred an event even
more extraordinary, as far as the relations between China and Formosa
were concerned. This was the appearance in the sea-coast villages of
Fokien Province, China, of a band of several hundred Formosans. These
men came, it is said, for the purpose of pillaging iron from the
homes and shops of the Chinese. This metal they valued above anything
else in the world,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> because they had
learned that it could be made into spear-heads and arrow-heads, also
into knives, more serviceable than those made of flint. They were
not able, apparently, to smelt the crude ore, but they understood
the building of forges, and were skilful<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> in “beating
ploughshares into swords”&mdash;to paraphrase. Locks, bolts,
nails, from the houses of the Chinese villagers, were grist to the mill
of these Formosans, as was anything else made of iron on which they
could lay their hands. It is said that before they could be driven
away they had secured a large store of iron, in various forms, much
of which they succeeded in carrying off in their boats. This is the
only occasion on record on which the Formosan “barbarians”
ventured to cross the channel which separates their island from China;
or at least the only one on which they succeeded in doing so.</p>

<p>It was not until the Yuan dynasty (in the early part of the
fourteenth century), during a war between China and Japan, that a
Chinese expedition proved that Formosa did not belong to the Lu-chu
group; this with tragic consequences to an eminent Chinese scholar
of the day. The history of the Yuan dynasty records that “a
literate of Fokien Province advised attacking Japan through the
Lu-chu Islands.” This literate, believing Formosa to be one
of the Lu-chu group, begged the Chinese admiral, Yangtsian, to set
sail first for that island. It seems that it had been the intention
of Admiral Yangtsian to sail from North China directly to Japan,
but, with that respect for reputed scholarship characteristic of the
Chinese, the admiral listened to the advice of the literate; the latter
being promoted to naval rank, and asked to join the expedition as
adviser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>This expedition proved that the principal island of the Lu-chu
group lay many <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> to the north of Formosa. China was the gainer
in geographical knowledge; but the admiral lost the advantage which
he probably would have gained had he sailed from North China, and
his adviser, the literate, lost his head&mdash;not figuratively, but
literally. Even after this expedition, however, Formosa was still
called “Little Lu-chu.”</p>

<p>It was not until the time of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) that the
island seems to have been called Taiwan. In Chinese records of this
period the name “Taiwan,” as applied to the island, appears
for the first time. Indeed, for some reason, Chinese authorities
seem to consider that the “authentic history” of the
island begins from the time of the Ming dynasty. The event which
in Chinese chronicles dates the beginning of this “authentic
history” was the visit&mdash;an unintentional one&mdash;in
about 1430, of the eunuch, Wan San-ho, an officer of the Chinese
Court. Wan San-ho had been on a visit to Siam, and was on his way
back to China, when the boat on which he was sailing was struck by
a typhoon and blown so far out of its course that the captain was
obliged to take refuge in the nearest port, which happened to be on
the south-west coast of Formosa, near the present town of Tainan.<a
name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is recorded that Wan San-ho remained for
some time on the island, and when he eventually returned to China<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> took
back with him herbs and plants of high medicinal value. It is said
that the Chinese still use in their pharmacopœia herbs grown from
the seeds of those brought from Formosa by Wan San-ho in the fifteenth
century. For the accuracy of this statement I, of course, cannot vouch;
nor could my Chinese-Formosan friend who first told me the story of Wan
San-ho. He, however, evidently believed it to be true.</p>

<p>It was also during the Ming dynasty that the first association of
the Japanese with Formosa is recorded. This was about the close of what
is known in Japanese history as the Ashikaga dynasty, which lasted from
1336 to 1443. At this time the Japanese Empire was torn by internal
conflict, and was the scene of constant strife between contending
political parties, the followers of the Great Daimyos. During this
period of disorder Japanese pirates, under the banner of <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Hachiman</i>
(the Japanese God of War), plundered the villages on the coast of China
and established headquarters, first on the Pescadores&mdash;the small
group of islands off the west coast of Formosa&mdash;and later at the
port that is now known as Keelung, on Formosa proper.</p>

<p>This seems to have been a harvest-time for Japanese pirates.
Unrestrained by authority at home, and finding no enemy stronger
than themselves on the sea, they made raids not only on the towns
of the China Coast, but made successful plundering expeditions
even as far south as Siam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> The booty from these raids, it seems, was
first brought to Keelung, then sent to Japan, where it was sold at a
high profit. Those were days in which bold buccaneers waxed fat.</p>

<p>Nor were the Japanese pirates allowed to reap the harvest alone.
At the same time that these men had headquarters at Keelung, in the
north of Formosa, Chinese pirates had established headquarters near
Tainan, in the southern part of the island. If the records report
truly, the intercourse between the Chinese and Japanese pirates does
not seem to have been unfriendly, even while their respective nations
were at war with each other&mdash;outlaws presumably being absolved
from the obligations of patriotism. This state of affairs lasted for
over a hundred years. During the sixteenth century Formosa, which
was then known to the Japanese as “Takasago,” seems to
have become a sort of “clearing-house” between China and
Japan&mdash;a link between nations the “respectable”
portions of whose populations were estranged. In the early part of that
century the Chinese pirates were united under the leadership of Gan
Shi-sai, grandfather of the famous Koksinga, shrines to whose memory
recently erected by the Japanese&mdash;because it has been learned
that his mother was a Japanese&mdash;one sees everywhere in Formosa at
the present time.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The sixteenth century was a rather noteworthy one in the history
of Formosa. It was during this century that the Hakkas&mdash;the
outcaste class of China&mdash;fled to Formosa to escape persecution
in the mother-country. And more important, at least from the European
point of view, it was in the sixteenth century that Europeans first
learned&mdash;as far as there is any record&mdash;of the existence
of the island. It is sometimes said that the Portuguese had a fort
in Keelung about 1590. Of this there seems to be no definite proof.
Not only was this the opinion of the Chinese-Formosan who first gave
me in outline the history of the island, but later investigation
on my own part failed to find proof, or even trustworthy evidence,
of the existence of such a fort. However, there can be little
doubt that the Portuguese navigators, sailing down the west coast
of the island, gave to it the name by which it is known to-day to
Europeans&mdash;“Ilha Formosa” (Beautiful Island).<a
name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Dutch navigator Linschotten, in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> the
employ of the Portuguese, so recorded it in his chart in the latter
part of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>It was early in the next century that the Dutch, as a nation, first
came into touch with Formosa. In 1604 the Dutch admiral, Van Narwijk,
sailed for Macao, in the south of China; but a typhoon&mdash;that
frequent occurrence in the China Sea&mdash;drove him to the Pescadores.
While there he gained a knowledge of the near-by large island of
Formosa, which knowledge, it is said, was responsible for the
later&mdash;temporary&mdash;Dutch dominance of the island. Another
typhoon, however, resulting in another wreck, brought about the actual
first landing of Dutchmen on Formosa proper. This was in 1620, when a
Dutch merchant ship was wrecked near the present town of Tainan.</p>

<p>At that time a Japanese colony was, with the permission of
China, established at this point. The Dutch captain, after
having first been refused by the Japanese land on which to build
a dep&ocirc;t for his goods&mdash;or that portion which he had
saved from the wreck&mdash;at last persuaded the men from Dai
Nippon to allow him to build a dep&ocirc;t “if this could
be built on ground no larger than that which could be covered
with an ox-hide.” The “heaven-descended”<a
name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> thought the <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Ketto-jin</i><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> (hairy
barbarian) mad. They naturally were not familiar with the European
classics. The Dutch captain apparently was, since he repeated the
famous manœuvre&mdash;said to have been responsible for the
founding of Carthage<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;of cutting
the ox-hide into very thin strips. With the raw hide<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> rope
thus made he succeeded in encircling a piece of ground amply large for
the building of a goods dep&ocirc;t.</p>

<p>The Chinese-Formosan, in relating this story, was so convulsed with
laughter that, in spite of his excellent English, it was at first
difficult to understand him. It seemed that what especially excited his
risibility was the idea&mdash;to him ludicrous&mdash;that a man of any
other nationality should be able to outwit a Japanese in a “sharp
deal.” He declared the story “too good to be true,”
but in the accounts of the early history of Formosa which I have read
since hearing the Chinese-Formosan recount the story, there seems
evidence for its verity.</p>

<p>At the time, however, when this incident is supposed to have
occurred&mdash;the early part of the seventeenth century&mdash;the
Chinese were really the masters both of the Pescadores and of
Formosa proper. It was they who, in 1622, gave the Dutch permission
to establish a fort on one of the Pescadore islands. This was done
under the command of Admiral Cornelius Reyersz, who wished to have a
stronghold from which he could sally forth to attack the Portuguese at
Macao. The next year an agreement was reached between Holland and China
by which the Dutch were to remove from the Pescadores to Formosa. In
1624 the Dutch built Fort Zelandia, the ruins of which are still to be
seen at Anping, the harbour-town near Tainan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The building of Fort Zelandia marked the beginning of Dutch
dominance in Formosa, a period which, though lasting less than
forty years, is one that has never been forgotten by the aboriginal
inhabitants of the island, as I found later, when I went among them.
During this time, however, the Dutch were not left in undisturbed
control of the island. Another European nation cast covetous eyes upon
the “Ilha Formosa.” Spain organised an expedition under the
command of Don Antonio de Care&ntilde;o de Valdez, which in 1626 set
forth from Manila, then a Spanish possession, and sailed north to the
“Beautiful Island.” The Spaniards succeeded in establishing
a colony at Keelung, which they called Santissima Trinidad, and
afterwards built a fort&mdash;San Domingo&mdash;at the other northern
port of the island, called by the Chinese and Japanese Tamsui.</p>

<p>For some years it seems there was a struggle between the Dutch
and Spanish for the domination of the island. Then in 1641 the
greater part of the Spanish troops in Formosa were recalled to
Manila, in order to take part in an expedition against the Moors<a
name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in Mindanao, the southernmost island of
the Philippine group. This gave the Dutch an opportunity of which
they were not slow to take advantage. They renewed their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
attacks upon the Spanish garrison, now greatly weakened. The
following year&mdash;1642&mdash;this surrendered, and the last
Spaniard&mdash;including the priests and the Dominican Friars, who had
come over with Don Care&ntilde;o de Valdez&mdash;left the island.</p>

<p>The Dutch were now left for a time undisputed masters of Formosa.
They built forts on the ruins of those evacuated by the Spanish at
Tamsui and Keelung. The old Dutch fort at Tamsui is still standing,
and is in a good state of preservation. It has walls eight feet
thick, and is used to-day as the British Consulate of the island.<a
name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"
class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>For about twenty years after the Spanish surrender in Formosa,
Dutch prosperity in the island was at its height. It is said that
during this time there were nearly three hundred villages under Dutch
jurisdiction, divided for convenience of administration into seven
provinces. The population of these villages, while recorded as being
“native,” evidently consisted of Chinese-Formosans. Finding
that agriculture was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> progressing among these people, the
Dutch minister, Gravius, is said to have sent to the East Indies
for “water-buffaloes,” the so-called caribou, and when
these arrived he distributed them among the Chinese population of
the island. “Water-buffaloes”&mdash;descendants of those
imported by the seventeenth-century Dutch&mdash;are used to-day
by the Chinese-Formosans for ploughing their rice-paddies (see
illustration).</p>

<p>Besides the Chinese population of Formosa under Dutch
administration, the aboriginal tribes in the mountains also
acknowledged Dutch supremacy, as they had never acknowledged Chinese,
and as, more recently, they have never been reconciled to Japanese.
Later, when I myself went among the aborigines, I received interesting
confirmation of the account given me by the Chinese-Formosan on the
boat, as the reason, apparently, that I was able to get into as
close touch with them as I did was because they regarded me as the
reincarnation of one of the seventeenth-century Dutch, whose rule over
them, three hundred years ago, has become a sacred tradition.</p>

<p>This tradition among the aborigines confirms the records made by
Father Candidius, and other Dutch missionaries of the period; although
the records, naturally, go more fully and accurately into detail. If
record and tradition are to be relied upon, the Dutch rule of Formosa
was marked by unusual benevolence, sagacity, and sympathy <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>with the
aboriginal people; tradition in this instance carrying more weight
than record, as the former is that of the subject people. Apparently
the Dutch administrators allowed the natives much liberty regarding
their own form of government; there was no interference in the choice
of headmen or chieftains on the part of the various tribes; nor was
there interference in the administration of tribal justice by these
headmen. The chief of each of the most important tribes was invested
with a silver-headed staff, bearing the Dutch commander’s coat
of arms. This was supposed to be used as an insignia of authority.
Thus only indirectly, and in a manner appealing to the vanity of the
savage chieftains, was recognition of the over-lordship of the Dutch
enforced. As also indirect was the influence exerted over the chiefs,
by a great feast given once a year by the Dutch governor, to which
it is said the chieftain of every aboriginal tribe was invited, and
where matters both inter-tribal and intra-tribal were discussed.
At the conclusion of this feast presents were distributed, and the
chieftains sent home with the blessing of the Dutch governor.<a

class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>This time of peace and prosperity for the aboriginal
tribes&mdash;the memory of which has remained among them as that
of a Golden Age&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> brought to an abrupt end in 1661, through
the invasion of Formosa by the Chinese pirate Koksinga, before referred
to, and his followers, who seem to have poured in hordes into the
island. The Dutch made a brave resistance; but, in all, they numbered
only a little over two thousand, and were unable to hold their own
against the vastly greater number of Chinese, who came over from the
mainland in the train of Koksinga. The latter is said to have owned
three hundred boats, in which he brought his followers from China.</p>

<p>In 1662 Governor Cogett, the Dutch commander, surrendered
to Koksinga. Then the Dutch who remained alive, both those who
had composed the garrison and also the settlers with their
families&mdash;the latter said to have numbered about six
hundred&mdash;left the island as speedily as was possible, most of them
sailing for the near-by Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p>From that time until 1895&mdash;the close of the Sino-Japanese
War&mdash;when Formosa passed into the hands of the Japanese,
the Chinese were lords of the island. Of this period of Chinese
dominance&mdash;over two hundred years&mdash;I learned little from
the Chinese-Formosan on the boat. He passed on to the recounting
of the sufferings of his own people&mdash;the Chinese on the
island&mdash;under Japanese rule, and the injustice to which they
had been subjected for twenty years. Of this he was still speaking
when the little steamer, rounding the rocky islet, the last of
the Lu-chu group, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> lies&mdash;or rather, rears
upward&mdash;as a sort of natural fortification in front of the chief
harbour of the island, puffed noisily into Keelung bay. My Chinese
friend, on bidding me good-bye, said he hoped that while I was in
Formosa I would come to his home and meet his wives&mdash;one of whom,
especially, was very intelligent and spoke a little English.</p>

<p>“Bradyaga”<a name="FNanchor_23_23"
id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> though I am, and accustomed to meeting all
sorts and conditions of&mdash;wives of men, I must, I think, for a
moment have looked startled. It was the man’s English accent
and his English point of view regarding many matters that made his
casual reference to his plural household seem incongruous. He must
have noticed this (indeed it was his remark that revealed my own
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> to myself; I thought I had my features under
better control), for he smiled and said: “I know in Europe and in
America it is different; certain things are done <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</i>&mdash;and
denied. It is a question which is better. But come to my home and see
for yourself how our system works.”</p>

<p>Later I met the wives of my Chinese-Formosan friend. There were
three of them&mdash;the intelligent one, the pretty one, and the eldest
and most honoured one, who was the mother of the eldest son and heir.
At least the last was called the “Great Wife” and the
“Honourable One” by the others; but there was no trace
of shame or of dishonour in the position of any of the women.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> All
seemed very proud, very happy, and curiously affectionate toward each
other and&mdash;greater test of a woman’s affection&mdash;even
toward each others’ children. Nor do I think that they were
“showing off” for my benefit; it was said by all who
knew them that this was their habitual attitude. Other lands, other
manners&mdash;and morals, perhaps.</p>

<p>As I went away from that interview with the several
Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;, I startled my ricksha-man&mdash;who thought I was
giving him some incomprehensible order&mdash;by humming, to the tune of
a chant I had learned from an aboriginal tribe in the mountains (for
this was after I had been in Formosa for several months), some words
written, I think, by Kipling:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>“There are nine-and-sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,</p>
<p class="i1">And every single one of them is right.”<br /></p>
</div></div>

<p>Then I met a missionary acquaintance. So preoccupied was I with
thoughts suggested by the visit I had just paid that I almost passed
the missionary without speaking. Turning back, I apologized both for my
seeming discourtesy in not speaking, and also for the barbaric chant,
to the tune&mdash;if tune it could be called&mdash;of which I was
humming Kipling’s words.</p>

<p>“A visit I have just made suggested the words, I
suppose,” I explained, laughing, “or brought them up
from some depth of the subconscious; I was rather fond of quoting
them once.” Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> I told the missionary of the visit from
which I was returning.</p>

<p>“Disgusting heathen!” she exclaimed. “Besides,
what have ‘different ways of constructing tribal
lays’ to do with heathen immorality?” She frowned
and looked puzzled. Then added more gently, as if explaining
to a child: “‘Lays,’ you know, means poetry,
and ‘constructing tribal lays’ just means writing
poetry; nothing whatever to do with the heathen and their horrible
ways.”</p>

<p>When we parted she adjured me to be more careful about wearing
my sun-helmet, assuring me that it was necessary in that climate.
“If one does not,” she explained, “something might
happen to one&mdash;to one’s head, you know,” she added
significantly, “and it would be a dreadful thing in a heathen
country....”</p>

<p>To go back for a moment to the day of my landing:</p>

<p>As my first glimpse of Formosa from a passing steamer, a few years
before, had fascinated me, so did my first glimpse of the island
after I had landed. Not the Formosa of Keelung quay with its hordes
of starving, skin-and-bone dogs&mdash;several of them dragging about
on three legs or with paralysed hindquarters&mdash;nosing for food
among the refuse,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or its crowd of
screaming, guttural-voiced ricksha-coolies and vegetable-and-fish
pedlars; or the arrogant Japanese officials&mdash;all<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in military uniform, with swords strapped at their sides<a
name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;bullying the Chinese-Formosans. But
the Formosa of the country through which I passed in going from
Keelung to Taihoku; the Formosa of scenery surpassing that of Japan
proper, both in natural beauty and in the picturesqueness of the tiny
peasant-villages, each village protected from tornadoes by a clump of
marvellously tall bamboos, whose feathery tops of delicate green seemed
to cut into the deep blue of the tropical sky; each house protected
from evil spirits by cryptic signs&mdash;said to be quotations
from Confucius&mdash;written, or painted, in black on red paper,<a
name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and pasted above and at both sides of each
doorway. Every village was further protected by a temple of brilliant
and varied colouring, on the roof of which wonderfully moulded dragons
writhed or reared. The inhabitants of these villages were, of course,
Chinese-Formosans. Very picturesque were these too, in their bright
blue smocks and black trousers; men and women dressed so much alike
that at a little distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> they were indistinguishable. Only on
nearer view was it clear that those who wore tinsel ornaments in
their hair and walked as if on stilts were women. When these hobbled
still nearer the cause of their queer stilted walk was obvious.
Their feet were “bound,” i.e. deformed and distorted,
pathetically&mdash;and to Western eyes abhorrently&mdash;out of
shape.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had always supposed that only among the
“upper classes” in China were the feet of the women
bound; those of the class who could afford to go always in ricksha or
sedan-chair. But all the women of the Chinese-Formosans&mdash;except
those of the despised Hakkas&mdash;bind their feet; rather, have them
bound in infancy. A woman with unbound feet is regarded as a sort of
pariah, and her chances of a “good marriage”&mdash;that
goal of every Chinese woman&mdash;are almost nil.<a
name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>These peasant and coolie-women hobbled nearer to see the train as it
stopped at the little stations between Keelung and Taihoku, especially
when it was reported that there was a white woman aboard. Many of
them could not walk without the aid of a stick or without resting one
hand on the shoulder of a small boy, thus maintaining their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> balance.
“Lily feet” were obviously a handicap in the carrying of
such burdens as most of these women had on their backs. In some cases
the bundles consisted of babies strapped Indian-papoose fashion to
the shoulders of the mothers&mdash;a custom common to both Chinese
and Japanese women; in other cases, of heavy bundles of food or of
faggots. Unattractive as were the figures of the women&mdash;the
entire leg being undeveloped, as the result of the cramping of the
feet from infancy&mdash;their faces were generally attractive; sweet,
with a wistful, rather pathetic expression. Only the lips and teeth
of the older women were often hideously disfigured from the habit of
beetle-nut chewing. The women out of doors who were not burden-bearing
were kneeling at the side of the streams and canals, used for
irrigating the rice-paddies, busily engaged in washing the family
linen&mdash;very much in public&mdash;or pounding it between stones. As
these washerwomen&mdash;and they seemed legion, for the Chinese devote
as much time to the washing of their clothing as the Japanese do to
that of their bodies&mdash;knelt, I saw the soles of their feet. In the
case of some of the poorer and more ill-dressed women, the splashing
water had displaced the rags with which their feet were bound, and
the “shoes” which were supposed to cover them. The feet
themselves&mdash;those members which every lily-footed woman most
carefully conceals&mdash;were exposed. The sight was not a pleasant
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned to watch the men, most of whom were working in the
rice-paddies. Some of them were ploughing&mdash;with much the same sort
of plough as those supposed to have been used by the ancient Egyptians.
To these ploughs were harnessed great “water-buffaloes.”
Here was picturesqueness unmarred by a suggestion of pain, even of
pain proudly borne, as in the case of the women. The greyness of the
“water-buffaloes” made a pleasing contrast to the vivid
green of the rice-paddies and to the blue smocks and high-peaked,
yellow, dried-bamboo-leaf helmets of the men. There are few things
more pleasing to the eye than a carefully terraced Chinese rice-paddy
in full verdure, with its graceful slopes and intricate curves of
shimmering green. If one approaches too near, the olfactory sense is
unpleasantly assailed. But on this first day in Formosa I was not
too near. I saw only the beauty&mdash;beauty of unusual richness and
variety; for, as a background to the rice-paddies, and peasant villages
and multi-coloured temples, beetled the great mountain crags, all
glowing in the brilliance of tropical September sunshine.</p>

<p>So beautiful was the scenery of the island that after I
was settled in Taihoku I made frequent excursions through the
country, scraping what acquaintance I could&mdash;by means of sign
language and the few words of Chinese-Formosan dialect that I
had learned from my servants&mdash;with the peasants, and taking
“snapshots” of their houses<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> and temples, and of their
children. Attractive as are all Oriental children, these little
ones seemed particularly so; perhaps because of the quaintness of
Chinese children’s costume, certainly as this is still worn in
Formosa.</p>

<p>On one of these excursions into the country I passed through
Keelung. My kodak was in my hand, but the idea of taking a picture
in Keelung never occurred to me. In the first place, I knew that the
taking of photographs of any sort in this port was one of the many
things “strongly forbidden” by Japanese officialdom. In the
second place, Keelung is a squalid and dirty town, with none of the
picturesqueness of the open country or of the tiny peasant-villages.
There was no temptation to photograph its ugliness, or the flaunting
evidences of its vice&mdash;vice of the mean, sordid type of Oriental,
sailor-haunted port-towns. I was hurrying through this hideous town
as quickly as possible, in order to reach a stretch of open country,
which I knew lay beyond, and which commanded a beautiful view of
the sea and of fantastically rearing rocky islets, when I felt my
arm roughly grasped. Turning around, I beheld a Japanese policeman.
Clanking his sword as he spoke, he demanded my name and address;
also he peremptorily demanded to know what I meant by coming to
take photographs in the great colonial port-town of his Imperial
Majesty, and asked if I did not know that this made me guilty of the
unspeakably abominable crime of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> lack of respect for his August Majesty. I
explained that I was not taking pictures in Keelung, had not done so,
and had no intention of so doing; that there was nothing there worth
photographing.</p>

<p>“But the fortifications,” he began; “you may
be looking&mdash;&mdash;” Then he stopped, apparently rather
abashed.</p>

<p>“What fortifications?” I asked. “I did not know
that there were any. Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, of course,” he answered, with confusion rather
curious in a Japanese policeman. “Of course there are not any
now. Only there might be some, one day, and&mdash;&mdash;”
Suddenly his brow cleared, as if under the inspiration of an idea that
would elucidate matters. “Anybody might be a German&mdash;a
German spy, you know, looking for a site to build some fortifications
perhaps.”</p>

<p>Although this was during the Great War, I knew that in Formosa
the fear on the part of the Japanese Government of a “German
spy” was practically nil. Also the Japanese policeman was
sufficiently intelligent to be able to distinguish one to whom
English was the mother-tongue (I was speaking with my secretary
as I walked) from a German, even though the latter were speaking
English.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But in those days
of war-hysteria when many English-speaking people became excitedly
sympathetic at the suggestion of German<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> spies and their
machinations&mdash;&mdash;. Yes, it was a clever move on the part of
the policeman. But it aroused my curiosity.</p>

<p>Afterwards I made several trips to Keelung, but without my camera.
And once, quite by accident, I learned how strongly fortified that port
is at the present time, and with what ingenuity the fortifications are
concealed. But that forms no part of the present narrative....</p>

<p>The fact that I had taken a “photographic apparatus” to
Keelung was recorded against me in the police records of Taihoku, and
brought several calls of an inquisitorial nature from the police.</p>

<p>To inquisitorial calls from the police and from other Japanese
officials, however, I became accustomed during my residence in Formosa.
My object in going there was to devote my leisure time&mdash;that not
engaged in teaching&mdash;to the study of the aboriginal tribes of the
island. There were reports&mdash;reports confirmed and denied&mdash;of
a pigmy race among the aborigines. These reports still further
stimulated my interest. I knew there were really pigmies&mdash;the
Aetas&mdash;in the Philippines. Were there, or were there not, such
people in the mountains of Formosa? I determined to find out.</p>

<p>My teaching duties occupied only four days a week. The other
three days of each week, besides all the days of the rather frequent
vacations, were supposedly my own, to employ as I felt<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
inclined. It was supposed apparently by both school officials and
police officials (the duties of the two seem curiously interlinked in
the Japanese Empire) that inclination would lead me to devote this
leisure to attending tea-parties at the houses of the missionaries
in the city and to distributing pocket Testaments among the young
men of the school. My predecessor (who had resigned the school-post
in order to take up avowed missionary work) had, it seemed, so
devoted her leisure, and to the mind of Japanese officialdom it was
incomprehensible that what one <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">seiyō-jin</i> woman had done all
others should not, as a matter of course, wish to do. When it was
learned that my inclination lay in another direction&mdash;that of
tramping the island, especially the mountains, and getting into as
close touch as possible with the aborigines&mdash;I received several
calls from horrified officials. The Director of Schools was especially
insistent (he said he was requested to be so by the Chief of the
Police Department) in wishing to know why I was not satisfied with
ricksha-rides about the city. This after I had made him understand
that I was not a missionary and that I was not particularly interested
in either pink teas or Testament distribution. “Why you want
to walk?” he demanded. “Japanese ladies never walk; only
coolie-women walk.”</p>

<p>I explained that obviously I was not a Japanese, also that I was
not at all certain that I was a lady, and that if the distinction
between coolie-woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> and lady lay in the fact that the one
walked and the other did not, I much preferred being classed in the
former category.</p>

<p>He scratched his head rather violently&mdash;a Japanese habit when
puzzled or annoyed. Suddenly the light of a great idea seemed to dawn
upon him. “Ah,” he exclaimed exultantly, the recollection
of some missionary speech or sermon evidently being made to serve the
occasion, “but they will say you are immoral, and Christian
ladies do not like to be thought immoral.”</p>

<p>This struck me as being amusing&mdash;for several reasons.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “and who is likely to think me
immoral?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody,” he answered impressively. “And
they will publish it in the papers&mdash;all the Japanese papers in
the city, and in the island,” he emphasized, “that you are
immoral. And, anyhow, you must do in Rome as the Romans do,” he
added triumphantly, evidently thinking he had convicted me out of the
mouth of one of the sages of my own Western world. Ever afterwards
this: “Do in Rome as the Romans do” was a favourite phrase
of his when he tried to insist upon my regulating my life in every
detail upon the model of that of a Japanese woman.</p>

</div>

<p>I am afraid I did not conceal my amusement on this occasion as
well as I should have done. Japanese officials take themselves,
and like to be taken, very seriously. I did not wish the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Director
to know that I saw through his ruse&mdash;and that of certain other of
the Japanese officials&mdash;a ruse directed towards keeping me from
coming into personal contact with the aborigines of the island and with
the more intelligent Chinese-Formosans, except when under the immediate
surveillance of the Japanese.</p>

<p>The Director said that it would be “all right” if he
accompanied me on my excursions into the mountains. Now the Director
happened to be a married man; his wife happened to be a Japanese lady
who “of course did not walk.” I tried to explain that if he
really thought there was danger of a scandal, the companionship of a
married man on these excursions, one whose wife was left at home, would
not tend to lessen this danger.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must continue to go my wicked way without
the protection of your companionship,” I said; “and if
‘they’&mdash;whoever ‘they’ may be&mdash;annoy
you with questions as to the object of my excursions into the
mountains, or if they are inquisitive as to whether I go there for the
purpose of a romance, legitimate or otherwise, tell them that I am one
of those who like to ‘eat of all the fruit of the trees of the
garden of the world&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Huh?” roared the Director. Both hands were at his head
now.</p>

<p>“Tell them ‘Yes’ to anything they ask about
me,” I said, “if that will set their minds at rest<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> and
prevent their annoying you with impertinent questions, as you say they
annoy you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell them you are immoral, that’s what
I’ll tell them; if you don’t just go about where
you can ride in rickshas, like other ladies,” wrathily
exclaimed the Director, attempting to rise and make a dignified
exit. Unfortunately, however, the Director happened to be fat,
and happened not to be accustomed to sitting in a chair.<a
name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Also his sword had become entangled in the
wicker-work arm of the chair, so that, when he rose, the chair rose
with him. This slightly spoiled the effect of the dignified exit. It
may have been due to the fact that it was necessary to extricate him
from the chair, that, before leaving, he became sufficiently mollified
to concede: “If you want exercise more than other ladies, you may
play tennis-ball on the school-grounds.”</p>

<p>A New Year Visit to the East Coast Tribes&mdash;Received by the
Taiyal as a Reincarnation of one of the seventeenth-century Dutch

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the objections of
the Director, and the suspicions of the police and of the
hydra-headed ‘they,’ I did not, while in Formosa,
confine either my interests or my exercise to ricksha-riding<a
name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or to “tennis-ball.”</p>

<p>My chief interest lay with the mountain tribes&mdash;the aborigines;
my chief exercise consisted in what my Japanese friends called
“prowling” among these tribes. Sometimes accompanied
by another English teacher and a servant, sometimes by my son or
secretary, sometimes quite alone, I went up into the mountains;
going as far as I could by “trolly” (or <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">toro</i>, as the
Japanese call it<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>)&mdash;a push-car,
propelled by Chinese-Formosan coolies, on rails laid by the
Japanese&mdash;rather, under their instructions&mdash;into the
mountains, for the purpose of bringing camphor-wood and crude<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> camphor
down to the great camphor-refining factory in Taihoku. From the
terminus of the <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">toro</i> line I “prowled.”</p>

<p>For permission to go into the mountains&mdash;and permission
for almost every movement on the part of a “foreigner”
is necessary in the Japanese Empire, in Formosa even more than
in Japan proper&mdash;I am indebted to Mr. Hosui and to Mr.
Marui, the two most courteous Japanese officials whom I met
in Formosa. I wish here to express my gratitude to both.<a
name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The tribe that I first studied, and of which I saw perhaps more than
of any other during my residence in Formosa, was the great Taiyal tribe
of the north&mdash;reputed to be the most bloodthirsty on the island,
and whose territory now covers almost as much as that of all the other
tribes together.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> From Taiyal territory
I sometimes “prowled” over into that of the Saisett and
Bunun tribes. This was perhaps not strictly according to official
permission; I was told that it was “too dangerous.” But the
spice of danger&mdash;perhaps also the “forbidden-fruit”
element&mdash;made these walks the more interesting; and I still have
my head on my shoulders.</p>

<p>The southern tribes I approached by water from the east coast; my
first visit to them being <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>during the first Christmas&mdash;rather,
New Year<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;vacation
that I spent on the island. Of this visit I retain a somewhat vivid
recollection, for two reasons. One because of the great cliffs of
the east coast, a glimpse of which I caught in passing; the other
because of the novel mode of debarkation, necessitated by stormy
weather, at Pinan,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a
href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> a port in Ami
territory, just north of that occupied by the Paiwan and Piyuma
tribes.</p>

<p>I embarked at Keelung, on one of the small coasting steamers,
sailing around the east coast to Takao,<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the southernmost port of the island. It was
just south of Giran<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a
href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that we passed
the great cliffs, said to be the highest in the world. For about
twenty-five miles these giant cliffs rise perpendicularly from
the sea to a height of about 6,000 feet. This towering wall of
granite&mdash;for such the rock seemed to be&mdash;is one of the most
imposing sights that in my wanderings about the world I have seen.</p>

<p>The weather was grey and drizzling when we left Keelung, but
it was just after we had left Karenko,<a name="FNanchor_38_38"
id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the first port south of the great
cliffs&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72"
id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> second day out&mdash;that the storm broke.
Those who have weathered a storm in a small boat know what this means.
In all the guide-books, and other books dealing with Formosa, that I
have seen, it is said that the sea-route, up and down the coast of the
island, “can be safely followed only during six months of the
year,” i.e. the spring and summer months. “Safely”
is probably, like other words, a matter of individual definition.
Personally I should be inclined to substitute the word
“comfortably” for “safely,” judging from my
own experience, both on this trip and on a subsequent one. That is, as
far as the actual voyage is concerned, if one be content to remain on
board the steamer from Keelung to Takao, where there is a good harbour.
With the exception of one or two who disembarked at Karenko, the other
passengers&mdash;all Japanese, naturally&mdash;seemed glad enough to
do this. I, however, had not come on this trip for the sake of the
sea-voyage, or with the object of reaching Takao&mdash;now a Japanese
town, the southern terminus of the railway which starts from Keelung
in the north&mdash;and which I could much more easily have reached by
rail had I wished to visit it. Takao, like all the other large towns
of the island, is on the western side of the great mountain range,<a
name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> contains no aborigines, and, especially
to one who has lived for some years in Japan, is of no especial
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"
id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The purpose of my trip was to study the aborigines of the east
coast and those who lived in the narrow south-eastern peninsula of the
island. It had not been possible for me to obtain police permission
to cross&mdash;or to attempt to cross&mdash;the great mountain range;
therefore I knew that my only hope of studying the eastern and
south-eastern aboriginal tribes lay in landing at Pinan. The captain
tried to dissuade me. He said that no man among his passengers would
think of landing; much less should a woman attempt it. Would I not
wait until another trip when the weather was calmer, or when I had a
companion&mdash;one of my own race (on this occasion I happened to
be quite alone and the only “foreigner” on board). He
really did not like to take the responsibility.... But I assured him
that he would be absolved of all responsibility “if anything
happened” to me&mdash;a euphemism that he several times used,
in his rather good, Scotch-accented English (he had been about the
world among seafaring men). Also that my Government would not hold his
Government responsible if “anything happened.” My blood
would be on my own head.</p>

<p>The captain at last rather lost patience. He told me of some
<em>sensible</em> missionaries&mdash;he stressed the adjective (he seemed
to think I was a senseless one; apparently he could not conceive of
any white woman wanting to go among “heathen” except
for the purpose of “converting” them)&mdash;who<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> in
similar stormy weather had sailed around the island three times before
they had dared to attempt a landing at a Chinese-Formosan village on
the coast. I explained that the length of my vacation would not make
such a proceeding possible in my case, and that rather than go on to
Takao, I preferred to go ashore&mdash;or to attempt to do so&mdash;in
one of the canoes in which some men of the Ami tribe had put out from
shore, and in which they were evidently endeavouring to reach the ship.
I was told it was their custom to do this, whenever a Japanese ship
approached, in order to barter commodities.</p>

<p>The captain said rather grimly that would be my “only chance
on this trip,” as, with the exception of a few articles which he
would give the savages, if they succeeded in reaching the ship when it
came to anchor, he would not attempt to discharge the cargo he had for
Pinan, but would defer that until the return voyage from Takao....</p>

<p>The Ami canoes succeeded in reaching the ship, and I succeeded
in persuading the captain to have a ladder lowered for me to
descend. This, however, only after further argument, for the captain
declared he had believed I was only “bluffing” (where
he had learned this delightfully expressive word I do not know),
when I had said that I was willing to trust myself to the Ami and
to one of their canoes. He said, however, that these coast Ami
were <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">sek-huan</i>&mdash;“half-tame,” he explained,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> when
interpreting the expression&mdash;and that as far as my life was
concerned, this would probably not be in danger, if I succeeded in
reaching the shore; that is, so long as I did not venture into the
interior. On this point I would make no promise, and the captain did
not press the matter. He was probably glad to be rid of a passenger
whom he evidently regarded as a missionary of less than average
missionary intelligence. To do him justice, however, when the canoes
were tossing on the waves at the side of the ship, he called down to
one of the savages, who was evidently the chief, or leader, of those
who had ventured out, a few words in mixed Japanese and Ami dialect.
This he assured me was an order to look well after my life and comfort.
The fact that I understood enough Japanese to know that the captain
referred to me as the “mad one,” did not detract from my
appreciation of his order.</p>

<p>I clung to the ladder until the crest of a wave brought the little
canoe sufficiently high for me to drop into the arms of the chief, who
deposited me, also the small bag I had with me&mdash;which one of the
crew of the steamer had thrown down to him&mdash;in the bottom of the
boat. Then shouting an order to the men in the several other canoes,
the chief and the one other man in the same canoe with him&mdash;and
me&mdash;began to paddle for shore. The order that the chief shouted
was evidently to the effect that the men in the other boats were
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wait and get certain things from the steamer, for on looking back,
when the canoe in which I was rose on the crest of a wave, I could
see bundles being lowered from the ship’s side into the canoes.
What these contained I do not know, and soon it became impossible
to watch, for the waves rose higher; the salt water was in my eyes,
and was pouring constantly over my head and face. I was drenched to
the skin, in spite of the supposedly waterproof coat that I wore.
The chief’s assistant had given up paddling and was vigorously
bailing the boat with a large gourd, or calabash. The chief alone
paddled.</p>

<p>I had been in the boats of other Pacific islanders; these had been
much more skilfully managed. I soon realized that in seamanship the
Formosan aborigines could not compare with the Hawaians, the Filipinos,
or with most of the peoples of the South Seas; perhaps for one reason,
because their canoes carry no outrigger. Or is this effect, rather than
cause? Is it because of their lack of seamanship at the present time
that they venture into the waves in outriggerless canoes?</p>

<p>At any rate, whatever they lack in skill in the navigation of
sea-craft, the Ami at least are not lacking in personal bravery,
or in a sense of responsibility. When the canoe was swamped by
the waves&mdash;as, soon after leaving the ship, I realized must
inevitably be the case&mdash;the chief motioned me to get on his
back, and when I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> done so, began to swim for shore. He did
this quite coolly, almost as if it were a matter of course, although
he had never before seen a white woman; apparently regarding the whole
affair from the Oriental, “it is ordered,” point of view.
The other man in the boat seemed for a moment to be more at a loss,
but at an order from the chief he dropped the now useless paddle,
which for some reason (or none) he still held, and rescued my little
travelling-bag, first taking the handle between his teeth, then, in
spite of the waves, managing in a rather dexterous fashion&mdash;by
means of the strip of homespun hemp-cloth which he had been wearing as
a loin-cloth&mdash;to lash it to his shoulders, swimming with legs and
one arm as he did so.</p>

<p>Thus from the water&mdash;literally&mdash;I reached the territory of
the east coast tribes and southern tribes of the island. What I learned
of their manners and customs I shall write in its proper place.<a
name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But I want here to record my appreciation
of the courage and also the cool, matter-of-course calmness of the
Ami chief, whose presence of mind undoubtedly saved my life on this
occasion, as my own awkward attempts at swimming would never have
carried me through those waves. So rough were they that it was
with difficulty I was able even to cling to the back of the chief.
Had the water been colder I should probably not have been<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> able
to do so. But at that latitude&mdash;a little south of the Tropic of
Cancer&mdash;sea-water, even in January, is never numbingly cold.</p>

<p>Rather different was my experience on the occasion of another
winter vacation during my stay in Formosa. That vacation I spent in
the mountains, as I wished to visit certain sub-tribes of the Taiyal
that I had not seen. Because of the altitude, it was&mdash;certainly
by contrast with the plain below&mdash;bitterly cold. There had
been flurries of snow during the day. I had with me, as guide and
luggage-bearer, a Chinese-Formosan coolie, an elderly man, who was
supposed to be well acquainted with the mountain trails&mdash;to have
tramped them since his youth, when as a charcoal-burner he had ventured
into the mountains for fuel. Thus had he recommended himself to me.
However, perhaps because of the snowy greyness of the day, he managed
to lose his way. I had&mdash;fortunately&mdash;a pocket compass with
me. In such Chinese-Formosan dialect as I had acquired&mdash;inadequate
enough&mdash;I attempted to explain the meaning of the pointing
needle. My guide declared he understood, and said that in order
to regain the trail we must go in a certain direction. Going in
this way, it was necessary to cross a stream, which usually was
little more than a shallow brook. Because of the winter rains,<a
name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a> however, this had become so swollen that
it was almost a torrent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> and when we reached it we found, instead
of a shallow stream that could easily have been waded, or crossed
over on stepping-stones, a great body of water, dashing over fallen
trees, and swirling around boulders which normally lay far beyond its
banks.</p>

<p>My guide, accustomed, as are all Chinese coolies&mdash;both in
Formosa and on the mainland&mdash;to carrying burdens on his back,
volunteered thus to carry me, declaring he could easily do so. I
acquiesced; and thus “pick-a-back” fashion we started. The
guide was a tall man, and, though the water came well up on his thighs,
he felt his way carefully with a stout staff that he carried, and all
seemed going well, in spite of the fact that it was growing dark,
when, without warning, the man gave a startled, guttural cry&mdash;in
the unexpected fashion of the usually phlegmatic Chinese when really
frightened&mdash;shook me from his shoulders, and, stooping until his
whole body was submerged in the water, shuffled rapidly to a boulder
behind which he crouched. Dropped thus suddenly almost to my waist into
very cold water, which was running with a swift current, I was nearly
swept off my feet. I managed, however, to make my way to a boulder,
near the one behind which my guide was cowering. As I drew myself up
out of the water on to the boulder, I angrily demanded of him the
reason of his extraordinary behaviour.</p>

<p>“Light of Heaven,” the man replied, in a low<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> voice,
between chattering teeth, “be not angry. It is a <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>&mdash;a
head-cutter&mdash;there.” With a motion of his head he indicated
a figure that I had not seen, standing at the edge of the water.</p>

<p>“I was wary,” my guide continued, “I heard a
movement in the bushes. I looked up&mdash;I saw. Now our heads must
surely go. As it was with our fathers&mdash;&mdash;” The man
continued to murmur, growing more incoherent in his terror, and
evidently more than half benumbed with the cold, as I found myself also
becoming.</p>

<p>I decided that possible decapitation was preferable to
freezing&mdash;especially as the agreeable stage of pleasant dreams,
which is said to accompany actual death from cold, had not been
reached; only that of extreme discomfort. The small weapon that I
usually carried with me on these mountain trips was in my hand-bag,
which, with my other impedimenta, was on the bank that we had left.
My guide had promised to return for these things after carrying me
across the water. However, there are times when it is better to flee
from evils that one knows.... I hailed the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, and, although
he spoke a variety of Taiyal dialect a little different from that
of which I knew a few words, he evidently understood the situation.
Indeed, under the circumstances, words were scarcely necessary for
such understanding. The man’s grin of comprehension pleased
me. It was so human&mdash;so <em>Aryanly</em> human&mdash;that it was<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
refreshing after the mask-like stolidity of both Chinese and Japanese
to which for some time I had been accustomed; for these two peoples,
however differing in other respects, are on this point at one.
They equally regard it as a mark of the lowest breeding to allow
any expression of emotion&mdash;of genuine feeling, of whatever
kind&mdash;to be reflected in their features. Even the coolies,
imitating their masters, have, as far as possible, adopted the code of
the latter on this point. All wear a mask that is seldom, or never,
dropped. The <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, however, are not trained in Confucian ethics;
hence the play of joy and sorrow, of amusement and of other emotions,
on their more mobile features.</p>

<p>The expression of that particular <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, at the moment, was one of
mixed amusement and sympathy. I am afraid that he rather enjoyed the
plight of the cowering Chinaman. For generations the Chinese-Formosans
and the aborigines of the island have been hereditary foes. However,
I made him understand that my guide&mdash;or the one who was supposed
to act in that capacity&mdash;was not to be molested. The <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>
nodded in comprehension. Then by signs he made me understand that he
would&mdash;if I so chose&mdash;carry me in safety to his side of
the water, which he had seen I was trying to reach. My clothing was
drenched, I was chilled to the bone, my fingers I found too numb to
move. I realized that my hold on the boulder could not last much<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> longer.
The Chinese I knew could not be depended upon in the proximity of
the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>. Indeed, the poor wretch (the Chinese) I feared could
scarcely manage to get himself out of the water, so completely had he
been unnerved by the unexpected appearance of the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>&mdash;one
belonging, it seemed, to a sub-tribe which he had especial reason to
fear. For me it was a choice between trusting myself unaided to the
torrent&mdash;and, in my benumbed condition, I knew I should soon
be swept off my feet&mdash;and accepting the offer of the friendly
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>. Naturally I chose the latter alternative.</p>

<p>When I signalled the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i> my acceptance of his offer, he again
grinned, took his knife from his loin-cloth and, holding it out of
reach of the water, stepped into the stream, which swirled about his
loins. I was glad enough to slip from my precarious hold on the boulder
to the shoulders of the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, who, true to his word&mdash;as in
my dealings with the aborigines I found them always to be with those
who have not betrayed them&mdash;carried me safely to the shore. Then
still holding me on his shoulders, for I was too benumbed with cold
and fatigue to walk, he strode on to a fire a little distance away,
around which a number of his people were gathered. I learned later that
these were members of a village community higher up in the mountains,
whose bamboo huts had been destroyed by recent torrential rains. The
homeless people were camping temporarily near<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> the foot of a great
tree, in the branches of which the spirits of their ancestors were
supposed to dwell; also the spirits of the Great White Fathers of
Long Ago&mdash;obviously the seventeenth-century Dutch&mdash;to whom
the priestesses of the demolished village had been offering constant
prayers. My appearance among them was hailed as an answer to their
prayers, which accounted for the fact, as I also later learned, that
when I was carried into camp&mdash;a very benumbed and bedraggled
goddess&mdash;both men and women fell on their faces, and some of the
children fled shrieking in terror.</p>

<p>I have since wondered whether perhaps these two chance
occurrences&mdash;one a storm at sea, the other a torrential rainfall
in the mountains, which by accident brought me among two divisions of
the aborigines, one those of the east coast, the other those of the
northern mountains, in the fashion that I have described&mdash;had not
something to do with the very friendly relations which existed between
these “Naturv&ouml;lker” and me. Certainly the r&ocirc;le
of the sea-born (or river-born) goddess was not one that I was anxious
to play, or that I had in mind, on either occasion. But a few chance
words of some of the people&mdash;after I had learned a little of their
language&mdash;led me to believe that the fact that I had “come
to them out of the water” contributed to the esteem in which
I was held; made certain in their minds the conviction that I was
the spirit of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> beloved white rulers of old, returned
from the elements. (Why a spirit should choose this particularly
uncomfortable method of approach&mdash;or of return&mdash;was not quite
clear.) That I had come among a matripotestal people probably accounted
for the fact that none of the aborigines seemed to think it strange
that the spirit of one of the Great White Fathers should choose to
reappear in the body of a woman. That such a spirit had returned seemed
to be the general supposition among the northern tribes. Among those of
the south there were some who held, apparently, that a Goddess of the
Sea (or “from out of the sea”) had come to them&mdash;one
to whom semi-annual offerings were customarily made.</p>

<p>When I realized the reason for the regard in which I was held by
these people a sense of the ludicrous overcame me. School-day struggles
with Virgil&mdash;buried in some region of the subconscious&mdash;were
recalled; these even more strongly when one day I overheard a
discussion among some of the tribespeople regarding my walk. I neither
hobbled as did the Chinese-Formosan women, nor did I walk with the
toed-in, short steps of the Japanese women (a few of the coast
aborigines had seen Japanese women).</p>

<p>“Feet strangely covered, stone-defying. With no burden on her
back, freely, with long steps, she walks, as must the females of the
gods from whom we spring.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et vera incessu patuit dea</i>,” etc. Curiously<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> similar
the idea, though the words in which this time it was voiced were those
of this strange Malay dialect.... The childhood of the world! Still in
odd comers it exists, and can, with seeking, be found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">THE PRESENT POPULATION OF FORMOSA</p>

<div class="center-block">
<div class="intro">
  <p>Hakkas and other Chinese-Formosans, Japanese, Aborigines.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> regards this particular odd
corner of the world, naturally, in my peregrinations about the
island, I picked up a certain amount of information. Among other
things, I learned that those who make up the vast majority of the
population of the island at the present time, and who are known
as “Formosans”&mdash;this not only among themselves,
but who also are so called (i.e. <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Taiwan-jin</i>, “men of
Formosa”) by their Japanese conquerors, and by Europeans
resident in the island&mdash;are Chinese; that is, descendants
of the immigrants from the mainland of China. Of these, between
80,000 and 90,000 are Hakkas, originally from the Kwantung
Province of China&mdash;a people rather despised by the other
Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The remaining nearly
3,000,000 “Formosans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>” are descendants of Chinese from
the Fukien Province of the mainland, and most of them speak the Amoy
dialect of Chinese, though a few speak the dialect of Foochow.</p>

<p>The Japanese, who since the treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) have been
masters of the island, number between 120,000 and 125,000, and are
constantly increasing in population. All official positions, and those
of authority of any sort, are in the hands of the Japanese as is now
all the wealth of the island.</p>

<p>The aboriginal population it is naturally more difficult
to estimate. But the number of the aborigines at the present
time cannot, in reality, exceed 105,000. Personally I doubt
if a carefully taken census would reveal that number.<a
name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Certainly the aboriginal population is
steadily diminishing, and all tribes are being driven constantly
farther up into the mountains; or, in the case of certain
tribes&mdash;such as the Ami and Paiwan&mdash;are being more rigidly
confined to the precipitous, barren east coast. The whole of the
island&mdash;including the marvellously fertile great plains on the
west side of the central mountain range&mdash;was naturally once in
the hands of the aborigines. But during the Chinese dominion of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> the
island, from the conquest of Koksinga (1662) to the close of the
Sino-Japanese War (1895), the aboriginal population was&mdash;if all
reports and all records, including those of the Chinese themselves,
speak truly&mdash;treated with systematic cruelty and with ruthless
greed and rapacity. Sometimes by wholesale slaughter, sometimes by
fraud and cunning, the Chinese gradually pushed the aborigines back
into the central mountain range, or, as the Japanese to-day are
doing, confined them to the sterile, ill-watered east coast, and thus
gained for themselves possession of the whole of the broad, level,
western sea-board; and even of those valleys between the mountains
where rice and tea could be made to grow. Chicanery was often cheaper
than gunpowder. An aborigine would fancy a gun or a red blanket. A
Chinaman would supply him with the commodity desired and would take in
exchange, or more frequently “as security,” fertile fields.
Naturally&mdash;to one who knows the habits of the aborigines&mdash;the
“security” was seldom redeemed, and the Chinaman became the
owner of the land.</p>

<p>If an effort were really made by an exceptionally industrious or
far-seeing aborigine to redeem his land, some method was usually found
by the Chinaman to thwart this effort. The land remained in Chinese
hands.</p>

<p>Since 1895 all the land of agricultural value in the island
has passed from the hands of the Chinese-Formosans into those
of their Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> conquerors; this usually by force
and extortion, the Chinese having suffered at the hands of the
Japanese, much as they had forced the aborigines to suffer
at their hands during the preceding two hundred years.<a
name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The well-being, or the reverse, of the aborigines has been
little affected by the change of masters. On this point I should be
contradicted by the Japanese, who would point out that they have
introduced the eating, and&mdash;as far as this is possible in the
mountains&mdash;the cultivation, of rice, instead of millet, among
the aborigines. Also they would lay stress upon the fact that they
have established among the aborigines schools for the “teaching
of Japanese language, Japanese customs, and Japanese manners.”
Apart, however, from wondering just how the displacement of millet
by rice, as a staple of diet, and compulsory training in Japanese
language and customs and Japanese “good manners” will be
of benefit to the aborigine (the eating of white rice will probably
give him berri-berri&mdash;as it has given this disease to so many
of the Japanese&mdash;from which up to this time he has been spared
by the eating of millet), one notes that the Japanese in their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
reports&mdash;official and otherwise&mdash;of the efforts of
their Government in the direction of the “civilization of
the aboriginal tribes” fail to remark upon the fact that,
because of their establishment of camphor “factories”<a
name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (see illustration) throughout the
mountains, they are encroaching further upon the territory of the
aborigines than ever the Chinese did. Also they fail to remark upon
the fact that bombs are dropped from aeroplanes upon villages of
the aborigines, in order to impress the latter with the omnipotence
of the Japanese Government, and with that of its Divine Emperor.<a

<p>As a matter of fact, the only people ever dominant in Formosa who
seem to have treated the aborigines with either kindness or equity
were the Dutch during their thirty-seven years’ over-lordship in
the seventeenth century. The story of this period of just and kindly
rule in their island has been handed down among the aborigines from
parent to child and still remains a tradition among them&mdash;one of
a Golden Age long past; just how long of course they have no idea,
but in the time of “many grandfathers back.” There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>a
tradition that the Dutch even taught the aborigines to read, and
also to write their own dialect&mdash;this in the “sign-marks
of the gods” (Roman script). Old documents written by their
ancestors are said to have existed among them even a generation ago.
These are reported to have been confiscated by the Japanese, as part
of a systematic and far-reaching attempt to eradicate the memory of
any culture other than Japanese. Whether or not this story of the
confiscation of old documents be true I do not know, but certainly
during my two years’ residence in Formosa I was not able to find
a single document of this sort among the aborigines.</p>

<p>Only the memory of past culture given by “fair gods who came
over the sea in white-winged boats”&mdash;or, as some of the
tribes have it, “came up out of the sea”&mdash;remains.</p>

<p>It seems that there exists among some of the tribes a
belief that a reincarnation of a former “Great White
Chief”&mdash;presumably Father Candidius, a Dutch priest,
who devoted his life to the care, spiritual and temporal, of
the aboriginal people&mdash;will return and help them throw
off the yoke of their Chinese and Japanese conquerors.<a

such a one being in rather marked contrast with the point of view of

<p>Physical Appearance pointing to Indoneso-Malay
Origin&mdash;Linguistic Evidence and Evidence of
Handicraft&mdash;Tribal Divisions of the Aborigines&mdash;Moot Question
as to the Existence of a Pigmy People in the Interior of the Island.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the aborigines are divided
into a number of tribes, and are also grouped&mdash;by the
Chinese&mdash;according to the “greenness” or
“ripeness” of their barbarity, yet they may, collectively
speaking, be regarded as belonging to the Indoneso-Malay stock, many
tribes being strikingly similar in appearance to certain tribes in the
Philippine Islands. Hamay, writing under the head of “Les Races
Mala&iuml;ques” in <cite>L’Anthropologie</cite> for 1896, says that
the aborigines of Formosa recalled to him the Igorotes of Northern
Luzon (Philippines) as well as the Malays of Singapore.</p>

<p>Regarding the Malays of Singapore, I cannot speak from personal
observation, as I have not been in Singapore; but as I spent six
months in the Philippines, shortly before going to Formosa,<a
name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a> I am able to confirm Hamay’s statement
as to the resemblance between Filipinos and Formosan aborigines. As
regards the tribe of Igorotes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> this resemblance extends also, to a
certain degree, to social customs and religious beliefs. Considering
physical resemblance alone, however, I should say that this is more
striking between the Formosan aborigines and the Tagalogs of Luzon than
between the former and the Igorotes&mdash;that is, where the Tagalogs
are unmixed with Spanish blood. The resemblance between the Tagalogs
and the Taiyal<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> tribe of northern
Formosa is particularly striking as regards physical characteristics.
The resemblance, however, ends here. The Tagalogs, as the result
of Spanish influence, are so-called “Christians”; the
Taiyal are not. The latter (Taiyal of Formosa) are a singularly
chaste, honest, and fair-dealing people; the former (Tagalogs) are
singularly&mdash;otherwise.</p>

<p>At least one Formosan tribe&mdash;the Ami, of the east
coast&mdash;has a tradition that its forbears came “in boats
across a great sea from an island somewhere in the south.” To
this tradition I shall have occasion to refer again.</p>

<p>In connection with the racial affinities of the Formosan aborigines
it is only fair to state that Arnold Schetelig says he “found
to his great surprise that Polynesian and Maori skulls in the London
College of Surgeons presented striking analogies with those collected
by himself in Formosa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>”</p>

<p>One can only surmise that the reason for the “great
surprise” felt by Schetelig upon noting the resemblance between
Polynesian and Formosan skulls was because he had previously stressed
the fact of the linguistic similarity between modern Malay and
the dialect spoken by the Formosan aborigines, and had gone on to
point out the “remarkable harmony between speech and physical
characteristics.” However, as, since the time that Schetelig
wrote, kinship of race between Indonesian and Polynesian&mdash;or,
at least, strong evidence pointing in the direction of a common
origin&mdash;has been established, there need, at the present
time, be no occasion for surprise; since Polynesian and Malay, or
“Proto-Malay,” peoples doubtless sprang from a common
stock, having its fountain-head in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Evidence which points strongly to an Indonesian origin of
the aborigines of Formosa exists in certain of their articles
of handicraft, notably the peculiar Indonesian form of loom,
the nose-flute, and the musical bow. (To these I shall refer at
greater length under the head of <span class="smcap">Arts and
Crafts</span>.) Also the custom of certain tribes&mdash;notably the
Yami, of Botel Tobago&mdash;of building their houses on piles.<a
name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This in a climate, and under conditions,
where there is no material need for such construction. When asked
the reason for this, one gets the reply customary to any<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
question that one may be foolish enough to ask as to the “reason
why” of any custom whatsoever, viz. “Thus have our fathers
done.”</p>

<p>To my mind, however, the strongest evidence showing Proto-Malay,
rather than Chinese, Melanesian, or other affinity, is supplied by
the language&mdash;considering the dialects collectively&mdash;of the
aborigines.</p>

</div>

<p>I am aware that the evidence of linguistic affinity as in any way
indicating that of race is rather disregarded by many anthropologists,
on the ground that contact&mdash;commercial or otherwise&mdash;between
peoples often affects linguistic interchange, or results in the
introduction of words from the language of one people into that of
another. With this I strongly agree, as regards different races living
on the same continent (the different races of Africa being a case in
point); or even as regards people living on neighbouring islands. With
the Formosan aborigines, however, there has been no contact within
historic times between themselves and other branches of the Malay or
Indonesian race. They themselves are not a seafaring folk, and the
people who have invaded their island&mdash;certainly since about the
sixth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, when Chinese records
first speak of it, during the Sui Dynasty&mdash;have been successive
waves of the Chinese themselves, the Dutch, the Spanish, possibly the
Portuguese, and the Japanese. In spite of this fact, the language to
which the Formosan dialects show closest affinity is Malay <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>proper,
that spoken on the Malay Peninsula, although there is some resemblance
to that spoken in Java, judging from Malayan and Javanese words given
in books, such as Wallace’s <cite>Malay Archipelago</cite>.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that about one-sixth of the words of the
various Formosan dialects, i.e. those spoken by the different tribes,
have a direct affinity with the Malayan language&mdash;that spoken by
the Malays proper. With so large a proportion of words bearing a close
resemblance, and taking into account the centuries-long isolation
of the Formosan tribes&mdash;as regards contact with other Malay or
Indonesian peoples&mdash;there can be little reasonable doubt that the
languages have sprung from a common stock, as probably the races have
done.</p>

<p>Regarding the tribal divisions of the aborigines, I shall mention
the nine tribes into which they are now usually grouped&mdash;in the
spelling of the names following the Japanese, rather than the Chinese,
pronunciation, viz.: Taiyal, Saisett, Bunun, Tsuou, Tsarisen, Paiwan,
Piyuma, Ami, and Yami. This is as nearly as the Japanese&mdash;or,
for that matter the English&mdash;can imitate the pronunciation of
the respective names by which these tribes-people call themselves.
Each name seems merely to mean “Man” in the dialect of
the tribe using it, except Ami (sometimes pronounced by themselves
“Kami”), which means “Men of the North.” This
is the tribe which has the tradition of having<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> originally come from
“somewhere in the south, across a great water.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ishii&mdash;the Japanese writer and lecturer on
Formosa&mdash;mentions only seven tribes of aborigines, omitting
the Tsarisen and Piyuma. This is according to the present Japanese
system of grouping. They (the Japanese) say that it is because of
“linguistic affinity,” i.e. because the dialects spoken by
the Piyuma and Tsarisen resemble the tongue spoken by the Paiwan, that
they group these tribes together. Perhaps! Certainly it is a fact that
the tribes omitted from Japanese enumeration are rapidly disappearing;
and their conquerors scarcely like to call attention to that fact.
At any rate, Mr. Ishii is honest enough to admit that “the
Piyuma possess a peculiar social organization and should be treated
as separate from the Paiwan.” The Saisett is another tribe that
is rapidly disappearing. Soon there will be only six tribes left to
enumerate&mdash;that is, very soon. Soon, as history goes, there
probably will be none.</p>

<p>The ethnological&mdash;or rather, ethnographical&mdash;map included
in this book indicates the various areas in which the different tribes
live, or over which they roam. However, the “Aiyu-sen”
(military guard line) of the Japanese is gradually, but steadily, being
drawn closer about the territory supposed to belong to the aborigines;
and well within this territory&mdash;even in the mountain range, in
which the aborigines were left undisturbed<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> during the Chinese
rule of the island&mdash;the Japanese Government has now established
stations for cutting down camphor trees, and at some points machinery
for extracting crude camphor, to be refined later in the great
factory in Taihoku. The work at the “camphor stations”
or “factories” in “savage territory” is
done by Chinese-Formosan coolies under the direction of Japanese
overseers. It is through this territory that the trolly (or
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">toro</i>) lines&mdash;referred to in Part I, page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>&mdash;have been
constructed, over which the man-propelled cars are pushed up the steep
mountain-sides.</p>

<p>As the tribes now exist, I should consider the Taiyal, of the
north, the largest, both in population and also as regards the
territory over which its members roam.<a name="FNanchor_51_51"
id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Next to the Taiyal, the Ami, of the east
coast, is the largest tribe, both in population and in extent of
territory; next, the Paiwan, of the south. On this point&mdash;that of
the relative size of population of the aboriginal tribes&mdash;I should
be inclined to agree with the Bureau of Aboriginal Affairs (Japanese),
of Formosa, rather than with Mr. Ishii, who considers the Paiwan the
largest of the aboriginal tribes as regards population.</p>

<p>The Japanese usually speak of the “Savages of the
North” and the “Savages of the South”; those
“of the North” being the Taiyal&mdash;or “tattooed
tribe,” so called because of the rather remarkable way in which
the faces of these people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> are tattooed, of which I shall speak
more in detail under another heading&mdash;together with the few
remaining members of the Saisett tribe. In speaking of the Taiyal
tribe, the “Report of the Control of the Aborigines in
Formosa,” issued by the Japanese Government, says: “Their
district [that of the Taiyal] comprises an area of about 500 square
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">ri</i> (2,977 square miles), with a population of about 30,000; <em>but on
account of the advancement of the guard-line in recent years, their
district is gradually becoming less</em>” (italics my own).</p>

<p>This statement as to the district of the Taiyal “gradually
becoming less” (something which is acclaimed as being to the
credit of the Japanese Government) might with equal truth be made
regarding the territory of the other aboriginal tribes, those who are
grouped together by the Japanese under the general term “Savages
of the South,” about all of whom the cordon is gradually being
drawn tighter.</p>

<p>The Taiyal is not only the largest and most powerful aboriginal
tribe on the island, but it is also&mdash;perhaps for this
reason&mdash;the boldest and least submissive. Most of the adult men of
this tribe have upon their faces the tattoo-mark signifying that they
have at least one human head to their credit. The other head-hunting
tribes of the island are the Bunun and the Paiwan.</p>

</div>

<p>In considering the divisions of the Formosan aborigines, it
would be well for present-day investigators to guard against the
error into which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>some European writers on the
subject, in the early numbers of the <cite>China Review</cite> (1873-4),
seem to have fallen&mdash;that is, the error of regarding the
Chinese terms of <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Pepo-huan</i> (<a href="images/i_119afs.png"><img
src="images/i_119a.png" alt="Chinese characters" /></a>) <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Sek-huan</i>
(<a href="images/i_119bfs.png"><img src="images/i_119b.png"
alt="Chinese characters" /></a>), and <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chin-huan</i> (<a
href="images/i_119cfs.png"><img src="images/i_119c.png" alt="Chinese
characters" /></a>), as signifying ethnic or tribal divisions. In
reality, these terms&mdash;in the Amoy dialect of Chinese&mdash;mean,
taking the words in the order given above, respectively:
“Barbarian of the Plain,” “Ripe Barbarian”
(i.e. semi-civilized), and “Green Barbarian” (i.e. wild,
or altogether savage). These terms were applied by the Chinese
indiscriminately to the various tribes, irrespective of difference of
dialect or of physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Regarding the latter point&mdash;physical characteristics: while,
broadly speaking, all the aborigines of Formosa conform to the general
“Malay type,” yet one who has been much among the different
tribes can distinguish without much difficulty&mdash;quite apart from
difference in tattoo-marking&mdash;between the tall, rather prognathous
Taiyal of the north; the more mongoloid type of the Ami and Paiwan on
the east coast; the handsomer, aquiline-nose type&mdash;approximating
to that of certain tribes of the American Indians&mdash;of the central
mountain-range Bunun; and the ever-smiling, gentler, darker Yami,<a
name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> Botel Tobago (Japanese “Koto
Sho”), the tiny island just south of Formosa proper (see
illustrations showing types of the different tribes).</p>

<p>To return for a moment to the Chinese system of
classification&mdash;one based on various degrees of culture (from the
Chinese point of view) existing among the aborigines: The <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Pepo-huan</i>
are about as non-existent in Formosa to-day as are the ancient Britons
in present-day England. They&mdash;the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Pepo-huan</i>&mdash;formerly lived
in the eastern plains, and the few who have not been exterminated have
been amalgamated with the Chinese-Formosan population. The indefinite
term of <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Sek-huan</i> is sometimes applied to those members of the Ami and
Paiwan tribes who have come most closely into contact with the Chinese.
Under the term <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chin-huan</i> are included all the other tribes of the
island.</p>

<p>Both Keane (in <cite>Man Past and Present</cite>) and T. L. Bullock,
formerly British Consul in Takao<a name="FNanchor_53_53"
id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (in <cite>China Review</cite>, 1873), speak of a portion
of the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Sek-huan</i> as being of light colour, compared with the other
aborigines, as having remarkably long and prominent teeth, large,
coarse mouth, prognathous jaw, and as having a weak constitution. Both
writers suspect a strain of Dutch blood in these people&mdash;though
just why weakness of constitution should be associated with Dutch
descent I do not know. Apparently weakness of constitution has<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> led
to non-survival in a country, and under conditions, where the law of
“survival of the fittest” holds rigidly true. Certainly I
could find no trace of these people&mdash;taken as a group&mdash;either
in the mountains or on the east coast. Half a century makes a great
difference in an aboriginal people, especially when contending against
stronger, conquering races.</p>

<p>The only extant people among the aborigines who can truthfully be
described as having a “fair complexion”&mdash;as far as I
could discover&mdash;are a subdivision, or local group, of the Taiyal,
called Taruko. The Taruko group live within a restricted territory
in the north-eastern part of the island, just behind the famous high
cliffs. Not only are the Taruko of lighter colour than the other
aborigines, but they have more regular and more clearly cut features.
Ishii states that “they [the Taruko] are believed to be the
oldest inhabitants of the island.” Of this I, personally, could
find no confirmation, though Mr. Ishii may have good grounds for making
the statement. At any rate, there is a tradition, both among themselves
and among the neighbouring Taiyal, that the Taruko originally lived
on the western side of the great mountains, and within the past few
generations have migrated to their present habitat. If this be the case
it is possible that they may have a strain of Dutch blood. Certainly
they are famous for their intrepid bravery and unbroken spirit. They
came under Japanese domination only in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> 1914; it is said they
were never under that of the Chinese. These people hold a myth as to
their origin, differing from that held by the other aborigines. Of this
I shall speak under the head of <span class="smcap">Religion</span>.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the ethnology of the aborigines,
reference must be made to the moot question as to whether or not
there exists in Formosa a pigmy people similar to the Aetas of the
Philippines. Regarding this most interesting point, I can only say that
I was never able to discover a race of pigmies&mdash;a tribe or group,
however small. But I did find, while in the territory of the Taiyal,
isolated instances of individuals with apparently a pigmy strain. This
particularly in the case of certain women&mdash;three or four. I do not
refer, of course, only to the difference in size between these women
and the Taiyal women&mdash;or the women of any of the other tribes;
but to certain characteristics of physique in which they radically
differ. For one thing, the shape of the head is distinctly different,
that of these very small women being more negroid than Malay, and
curiously infantile even for the negroid type of skull&mdash;i.e.
with disproportionately bulging forehead. Also the whole shape of the
body is more that of a child than is the case with most adult women,
either among Formosan aborigines or others. The opposition between
the great toe and the other toes is more marked than with the other
aborigines. And&mdash;perhaps most significant<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> feature of all&mdash;the
hair of these women is distinctly “crinkly,” whereas that
of the other aborigines of the main island, as of all Malay peoples,
is absolutely straight&mdash;a fact of which the small women are
evidently ashamed.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The colour of these pigmy women&mdash;if such they may be
called&mdash;is, however, not as dark as that of the Philippine Aetas
or the Andamanese Islanders. On the contrary, it is rather lighter than
that of the surrounding tribes-people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not take measurements of these small
women&mdash;in fact, I had no instruments for accurately doing
this&mdash;but I do not think their height can be over four feet two
or three inches. An interesting point in connection with them is
that the other aborigines among whom they live regard these women as
being “different.” They themselves&mdash;those whom I
saw&mdash;were taciturn and seemed averse to expressing themselves.
Also curious, in a tribe where few divorces occur and seemingly
little marital infelicity, all these tiny women whom I personally
knew were divorced or separated from their husbands&mdash;Taiyal men;
“mutual incompatibility” apparently being the cause.</p>

<p>What the true explanation is of the existence of these
“pigmean” women, differing in colour, in features, and in
physique from those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> surrounding tribe, I do not know.
It is possible of course that the few whom I saw were merely
anomalies&mdash;dwarf individuals of the tribe in the midst of whom
they lived. But this would scarcely account for the difference in
colour, still less for that in the character of the hair, even if it
did for the more infantile type of cranium and of general physique.
It must be remembered that these individuals referred to live in a
zone through which the Tropic of Cancer runs; consequently they may
be exemplifications of the theory sometimes put forward that every
race living in the tropics has its duplicate pigmy race. Or it may
be&mdash;and to me this seems more probable&mdash;that these few very
small and dissimilar women living among the Taiyal represent the
remainder of a pigmy people, now almost extinct, of whom all the men
have been killed, and of whom but a few of the women still survive.
And as these few (certainly those with whom I came into contact) seem
childless, it is obvious that within the very near future there will be
no representatives remaining&mdash;that is, if this last explanation
which I have suggested be the true one. This is one of the many points
in connection with Formosan ethnology which would well repay further
investigation.</p>

<p>It may be added that the speech of the women referred to&mdash;when
they can be induced to speak at all&mdash;seems more filled with
guttural “clicks” than is that of the full-blooded Taiyal
men and women.</p>

<p>One, or more, of these customs naturally exists among primitive
peoples in various parts of the world; it is the combination of these,
welded into a well-defined social organization, that makes the latter
unique.</p>

<p>That “head-hunting” should be included under the head
of “social organization” may seem perhaps a contradiction
in terms&mdash;head-hunting not being exactly a social custom. I
think, however, that anyone who has lived among a head-hunting tribe
will realize how closely this custom is interwoven with the fabric
of their whole social organization. It regulates the social and
political standing of the men of the tribe; it is directly connected
with marriage&mdash;no head, no wife; and is reflected in the games,
the songs, and the dances of the people. Moreover head-hunting is
regulated by a code as rigid as the code of “an officer and a
gentleman” in so-called civilized society&mdash;and is rather
less frequently broken.</p>

<p>Deniker, in speaking of the Dyaks of Borneo (see <cite>The Races of
Man</cite>, p. 251), aptly remarks: “A number of acts regarded as
culpable by the codes of all civilized states are yet tolerated,
and even extolled, in certain particular circumstances; such as
the taking of life, for example, in legitimate defence, in a duel,
during war, or as a capital punishment. Thus, in recalling examples
of this kind, we shall be less severe on a Dyak who cuts off a
man’s head solely that he may carry this<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> trophy to his bride;
for if he did otherwise he would be repulsed by all.” The
same charity for which Deniker pleads in judgment of the Dyak
may well be extended to the Formosan aborigine, who never thus
seeks private vengeance, whatever his provocation, on one of his
fellow-tribesmen,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> private disputes being
always laid before the chief&mdash;male or female&mdash;of the tribe
or before the chief-priestess, or a convocation of the elderly women
of the tribal group. Also when a Formosan has voluntarily given his
word to refrain from head-hunting, it is said&mdash;and my personal
observation would tend to confirm this&mdash;that he never breaks it.<a
name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The tribes among whom head-hunting still exists are the Taiyal,
the Bunun, and the Paiwan, though among the Bunun and the Paiwan to
a lesser extent at the present time than among the Taiyal. Among all
the other Chin-huan tribes it existed within the memory of the older
generation still living.</p>

<p>Among the Taiyal tribe&mdash;the great tribe of the northern part
of the island&mdash;one can tell at a glance who has “a head to
his credit,” by the presence, or absence, of the tattoo-mark
on the chin. Occasionally one sees the insignia of the successful
head-hunter tattooed on the chin of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> young boys. This
indicates that these boys are the sons of famous head-hunters and
that their hands have been laid upon heads decapitated by their
fathers; or that they have carried these heads in net-bags upon
their backs. This, by tribal code, entitles them to the successful
head-hunter’s tattoo-mark. Incidentally, it must be understood
that while the Taiyal are&mdash;largely because of their peculiar form
of tattooing&mdash;usually regarded as a single tribe, they do not so
regard themselves, but are composed of a number of sub-groups (it is
said twenty-six), who regard themselves as separate units; and who
consequently go on head-hunting expeditions against each other.</p>

<p>When a boy attains maturity he is supposed to celebrate
this by going on his first head-hunting expedition.<a
name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Usually several boys of about the same
age go together on their first expedition, accompanied by older and
more experienced warriors of the same group, or sub-tribe. Before
going on such an expedition an omen is always consulted&mdash;usually
a bird-omen, of which I shall speak more fully under the head of
Religion&mdash;and it depends upon the favourable or unfavourable
indication of the omen as to whether the expedition is undertaken
forthwith or is postponed. The Taiyal consider it more auspicious to
set forth on such an expedition with an odd number of men. They seem
to think the chances will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> greater of securing a head, which will
count as a man, and thus make up the “lucky even number”
with which they hope to return to the village.</p>

<p>During the absence of the warriors on one of these expeditions, the
women of the group will abstain from weaving, or even from handling the
material&mdash;a sort of coarse native hemp&mdash;which customarily
they weave into clothing. Except for the studious tending of the fires
in their respective huts&mdash;for if these were allowed to go out, it
would be considered a most evil omen&mdash;they do little until they
hear in the distance the cries which herald the return of the warriors.
Then, depending upon whether the cries denote victory or defeat, the
women prepare either for a festival or for a time of lamentation.</p>

<p>If the warriors have been successful&mdash;that is, if they have
returned with one or more heads of slain enemies&mdash;a great feast
is prepared, and partaken of by the men and women together. In this
respect Formosan feasts differ from the victorious warrior-feasts
of many other primitive communities, at which only the men are the
revellers. This difference also distinguishes the dance that follows
the feast, in which both men and women participate, the Formosan
aborigines forming an exception to the rule laid down by Deniker
that Malay men do not dance. As in feasting and dancing, so do the
women also take part in the drinking of wine&mdash;made by themselves
from millet&mdash;and in the smoking of tobacco. Among the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Taiyal, as among most of the other tribes, both men and women smoke
bamboo pipes&mdash;more of the size and shape of those smoked by
Europeans than are the tiny pipes smoked by the Chinese and Japanese.
These are, however, for some reason which they could not, or would not,
explain, often held upside-down while being smoked, the tobacco being
very tightly “jammed” into the bowl to prevent its falling
out.</p>

<p>Among the coast Ami, only the men smoke pipes, the bowls of which
are often decorated with bits of metal&mdash;bartered from the
Chinese&mdash;in imitation of the features of a human face. The women
of this tribe smoke huge cigars.</p>

<p>How tobacco was introduced into Formosa, where now it grows
practically wild&mdash;the leaves being gathered by the women&mdash;is
a mystery. Probably, however, it was first brought to the island by the
Dutch; and, once having been planted in a soil favouring its growth,
it continued to flourish and to spread, in spite of what in Europe
and in America would be called lack of cultivation. Now smoking is
universal among all the tribes of the main island of Formosa. Among
the Yami alone&mdash;of Botel Tobago&mdash;it is, up to the present
time, unknown; as is also, apparently, the drinking of any intoxicating
liquor. Another thing that differentiates these gentle people from
their neighbours of the main island, just to the north of them, is the
fact that none of them are head-hunters.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>To return for a moment to the present chief head-hunting
tribe, the Taiyal. At the time of feasting and dancing in
celebration of a victory, the head of the victim is placed on the
“skull-shelf” of the village&mdash;being often the last
addition to a pile of others&mdash;and food and millet-wine are placed
in front of it, food being sometimes inserted into its mouth. The
chief (often a woman), or high-priestess, of the village offers to the
last-decapitated head an invitation to the following effect: “O
warrior, you are welcome to our village and to our feast! Eat and
drink, and ask your brothers to come and join you, and to eat and drink
with us also.”</p>

<p>This invocation is supposed to have a magical effect in bringing
about other victories, and thus adding more heads to the skull-shelf
(see illustration).</p>

<p>The knives with which the heads of enemies have been cut off are
held in great reverence by all the tribes. Among one tribe&mdash;the
Paiwan&mdash;it is believed that the spirits of ancestors dwell in
certain knives, which have been in the possession of the tribe for
several generations.</p>

<p>Among the Paiwan, and also the Bunun, the successful warrior is
denoted, not as among the Taiyal by certain tattoo-marking, but by the
wearing of a certain kind of cap which is made by the women of the
tribe. The Paiwan, whose domain formerly extended all the way to Cape
Garanbi, had&mdash;and have still in certain<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> quarters&mdash;the
reputation of being cannibals, as well as head-hunters. A statement
to this effect is made in the <cite>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</cite> (see
article under the head of “Formosa”). This, however, I
believe to be a mistake; as did also George Taylor, for many years
light-house keeper at South Cape (Garanbi), under the Chinese regime;
one who probably knew the aborigines more intimately than any white
man since the time of the Dutch occupation. The superficial observer,
seeing a pile of skulls in a native village&mdash;often several skulls
over, or at the side of, the doorway of a chief’s house<a
name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;is apt hastily to assume that the
villagers must necessarily be cannibals. But, while head-hunters
certainly, I do not believe that the Formosan aborigines are, or ever
have been, cannibals.</p>

<p>Among the Paiwan a tradition exists that in “days of
old,” when their territory extended to the sea-coast,
“great boats” often came near their coast, from which
men landed; and that these men were in the habit of capturing
and carrying away numbers of the Paiwan people. Whether these
“great boats” were Chinese junks or Spanish ships from
the Philippines, I do not know. At any rate, among the Paiwan, the
killing of strangers&mdash;except those with fair hair and blue eyes
(which would indicate that the kidnapping invaders of the past were
not Dutch)&mdash;is alleged to be an act<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> of self-defence, to
prevent their being carried away, “as their fathers were.”
On what foundation of truth&mdash;if any&mdash;this tradition is built,
I do not know.</p>

<p>In this connection also the Paiwan claim that once, in those olden
days, when strangers were landing from one of the large ships, they
themselves (the Paiwan) took refuge in a “secret place among the
hills,” but they were betrayed by the crowing of a cock, which
revealed their hiding-place to the strangers, who killed many of them
and carried others away by force to their ship. This they give as their
reason for never eating chicken.</p>

<p>But as a neighbouring tribe, the Ami, also never eat
chicken, and assign for their abstention an entirely different
reason&mdash;viz. that “souls of good and gentle people dwell in
chickens”&mdash;it is not possible to give too great credence to
Paiwan tradition, or to their own explanation of their custom; this
being one of the many instances where various “reasons”
are given by a primitive people in attempted explanation of a
long-established custom.</p>

<p>In passing, it may be mentioned that it is only among the coast
tribes, such as Paiwan, Piyuma, and Ami, that the raising of chickens,
for the sake of their eggs, has been introduced&mdash;apparently by the
Chinese.</p>

<p>Among the Paiwan, as among the other aboriginal tribes, including
the Taiyal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> north, there exists the custom of
two great festivals during the year, one at seed-time, the other
at harvest-time. During these twice-yearly festivals there is much
feasting, much dancing, and, unfortunately, much drinking of millet
wine. That which distinguishes the Paiwan festivities, however, from
those of the other tribes is that once every five years on these
festive days the Paiwan play a game called Mavayaiya. This game
consists of a contest between several warriors, each trying to impale
on a bamboo lance a bundle&mdash;now made of bark&mdash;which is
tossed into the air, the one who catches it on the point of his lance
being considered the victor. Tradition among them asserts that in
olden days it was a human head&mdash;that of a slain enemy&mdash;which
was thus tossed about, a mere bundle of bark being considered a poor
substitute. But Japanese laws against head-hunting are strict, for
Japanese themselves have suffered from these expeditions&mdash;punitive
usually&mdash;and knives, even sacred ones, are no match against modern
rifles, or against bombs thrown from aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Similarly with the neighbouring tribe&mdash;now a small
one&mdash;that of the Piyuma. On a festival day, held annually,
a monkey&mdash;one of those with which the woods of Formosa are
filled&mdash;is tied before the bachelor dormitory, and killed by the
young men with arrows. After it is killed the village chief throws a
little native wine three times towards the sky, and three times on
the ground, near the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"
id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> of the dead monkey. Singing, dancing,
and feasting follow. The old people of the Piyuma tribe explain that
in the “good days of old,” when their tribe was a large
and powerful one, a prisoner, captured from some other tribe, was
always sacrificed on these festal occasions, but now they&mdash;like
the Paiwan, with their Mavayaiya&mdash;have to be satisfied with an
inferior substitute. It seems that one of the reasons why a monkey
is considered so particularly inferior a substitute for a man is
that the former can at its death bear no message to the spirits of
the ancestors of those who slay it. In the good old days every arrow
that was shot into the body of the man bore with it a message to the
spirit of the ancestor of the man who shot the arrow. Apparently it
was regarded as an obligation, one that could not be evaded, on the
part of the victim, to deliver this message&mdash;rather these many
messages&mdash;immediately upon his arrival in the spirit-world.</p>

<p>Even among the Paiwan head-hunting is on the decline, being much
less practised by this tribe to-day than among the Taiyal. Many of the
honours which were formerly paid to the successful Paiwan head-hunter
are now paid to the successful hunter of game, and the latter is now
even wearing the cap of distinction at one time reserved exclusively
for the former.</p>

<p>In game hunting the aborigines use either the old guns, obtained
from the Chinese by barter, long ago, or&mdash;in the cases
where these guns have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> been confiscated by the Japanese on the
ground of their owners being “dangerous savages”&mdash;they
have returned to the use of bows and arrows such as were used by their
ancestors before guns were introduced among them. The bow is simple,
usually made of wood of the catalpa tree, the bow-string being made of
the tough “China grass,” which grows on the island. The
arrow is made of bamboo, the arrow-head now being of iron, this being
pounded out from any piece of scrap-iron which the tribes-people can
obtain by barter.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of Formosan archery is that the arrows are
not feathered, as Japanese arrows are; also that in shooting the arrow,
this is always placed on the left side of the bow, whereas it is placed
on the right side by both Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<p>So much for the rather unpleasant subject of head-hunting, and those
customs which are associated with, or have sprung from, it.</p>

  </a>
   <p class="caption">TWO PAIWAN MEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN IN FRONT OF THE
HOUSE OF A PAIWAN CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>Turning now to the subject of the general political and social
organization of the tribes, taken collectively, perhaps the most
striking feature may be summed up in the remark of the Japanese
policeman who escorted me on one of my first trips among the
Taiyal: “Their head-man is a woman”&mdash;which rather
“Irish” remark holds true not only as regards the Taiyal,
but as regards other tribes as well. One often sees the queen, or
woman-chief, of a tribal group borne on <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>the shoulders of her
subjects, as she goes about the village, so that her sacred feet
may not touch the ground. So closely, however, are “Church
and State” bound together&mdash;that is, so frequently are
queen and chief-priestess one&mdash;that descriptions of certain
customs connected with the “woman head-man” must be
postponed until later, when these will be dealt with under the
respective heads of <span class="smcap">Religion</span> and <span
class="smcap">Marriage</span>.</p>

<p>Among the Paiwan&mdash;also the small neighbouring tribe of
the Piyuma&mdash;chieftainship seems to be hereditary, usually
descending from mother to daughter, although over some groups male
chiefs rule; this apparently being usual when the old queen has died
without leaving a daughter. Such instances are not infrequent among
a people with whom small families are usual. In this connection,
reference may be made to a statement which has been somewhat widely
disseminated regarding the children of the aboriginal women of
Formosa. It has been said that these women never allow their children
to live until they themselves are thirty-seven years of age.<a
name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This curious statement was made by one of
the old Dutch chroniclers of the seventeenth century, and has been
repeated, doubtless in good faith&mdash;on the strength of the Dutch
records&mdash;by more modern writers. Of this custom, however, I
saw no trace in any of the tribes during my residence among them.
On the contrary, I saw many young mothers&mdash;of various<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tribes&mdash;nursing and tending their babies with greatest devotion.
It is true that with them, as with many primitive peoples, twins are
considered “unlucky,” and the weaker of the pair is usually
killed at birth. Also, illegitimate children are not allowed to live,
Formosan standards&mdash;those of the aborigines&mdash;being curiously
rigorous on the latter point. Except in these instances, I saw nothing
that would suggest infanticide among any of the tribes, and heard
nothing of it. Both men and women seem particularly devoted to their
offspring. But, due apparently to the present hard conditions of life
among the aborigines, families are small and comparatively few of the
children born grow to maturity.</p>

<p>To revert for a moment to the customs of the Paiwan and Piyuma
tribes. A rather strict age-grade, or system of rank regulated
according to age, seems to exist among them. The older the man or
woman, the more is he, or she, held in reverence.</p>

<p>These tribes&mdash;and also the Tsuou, Yami, and Ami
tribes&mdash;have the “bachelor-house”<a
name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> system. That is, when a young man reaches
the age of fifteen or sixteen, he is obliged to leave the home of
his parents, and sleep in the bachelor-house until he is married.
This bachelor-house serves as a sort of combination dormitory,
military barracks, and club house. So strictly is the age-grade<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
system observed among the Piyuma that there are two club-houses: one
for boys from twelve to fifteen years of age; the other for young
men over fifteen. In both bachelor-houses&mdash;that of the boys and
that of the young men&mdash;the strictest discipline prevails. A
certain number of youths are assigned the duty of keeping the fire
supplied with wood (if the fire were allowed to go out it would be
considered an omen of disaster to the tribe); others that of bringing
water&mdash;which is usually carried in great bamboo tubes, borne on
the shoulders. Other duties are equably apportioned. Each age-grade
is supposed to obey without question the orders of those of superior
age.</p>

<p>The reasons assigned for having the young men live apart in
bachelor-houses are as various as are the reasons assigned for the
other customs previously referred to. The two explanations most
frequently given are: (<i>a</i>) that living apart makes the young men more
courageous and intrepid, especially as the bachelor-houses are usually
decorated with skulls of slain enemies of the tribe, or tribal group;
and (<i>b</i>) that it makes for chastity, and also for conserving the
delicacy of mind of the young women and children; that is, that the
latter may be surrounded only by staid, elderly people, and thus hear
no conversation unfitted for their ears.</p>

<p>These bachelor-houses are usually, though not invariably, built on
“piles” similar to Indonesian<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> buildings, often ten
feet above ground. Entrance to these houses is by means of bamboo
poles, up which the young men must climb.</p>

<p>One of the customs of the young bachelors among the Paiwan tribe
recalls a custom of the Hawaians and other Polynesians&mdash;that
is, on festal occasions they wear about their necks long garlands of
flowers.</p>

<p>Among the Ami a more complicated age-grade system prevails. In some
groups of this tribe there are ten age-grades; in others, twelve. Men
and women of the same age are accorded equal privileges, greatest
deference always being paid to the oldest. In some respects, the Ami
may be considered the most democratic of the tribes, seniority of each
in turn&mdash;rather than hereditary rank&mdash;conferring power and
prestige.</p>

<p>With the Taiyal, each sub-group has its own chief, or
“chieftainess.” With this people, however, the office seems
to be more elective than hereditary, the choice usually falling upon a
priestess whose ministrations have been especially successful either in
driving away the rain-devil (to be spoken of more fully under the head
of <span class="smcap">Religion</span>) or in interpreting omens which
have led to successful head-hunting expeditions.</p>

<p>The granaries, in which the year’s harvest of millet is
stored, are also under the charge of women, who deal out daily supplies
of millet to the women of the different families comprising the tribal
group. It seems tabu for men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> certainly of the Taiyal tribe, to
approach very near these millet store-houses.</p>

<p>To just what cause the women of the Formosan aborigines owe their
ascendancy it would be difficult to say. As a people the aborigines
have reached the stage of “hoe-culture”&mdash;a stage
which Deniker and some other anthropologists sharply differentiate
from “true agriculture” (i.e. with the plough), and
which usually precedes the pastoral stage, whereas “true
agriculture” follows it. Certainly this precedence of order
of culture is true of the Formosans (the aborigines). They have no
flocks or herds, no beasts of draught or of burden; they are strictly
in the “hunting stage” of civilization as regards the
men; yet the women scratch the ground with a short-handled primitive
hoe, and thus raise millet and sweet potatoes, besides digging
away the rankest of the weeds from about the roots of the tobacco
plants. Whether being concerned with the raising and storing of
the staples of life&mdash;millet and sweet potatoes&mdash;and with
the gathering and curing of the tobacco-leaves and the making of
wine&mdash;life’s luxuries&mdash;has given women the ascendancy
which they undoubtedly possess is a question. Personally I should
be inclined to think it had (on the principle that he who holds the
purse-strings&mdash;or the equivalent&mdash;holds the power). But
Lowie, the American anthropologist, with some force of argument, warns
of the danger of too hastily assuming that an agricultural stage<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
(“hoe-culture” or other) of civilization necessarily
implies “matri-potestas,” pointing out the fact that among
the Andaman Islanders, who are in the most primitive “hunting
stage,” women hold a far higher position than among the present
agricultural peoples of India and of many other parts of the world.<a
name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It may be that the “equal rights” (or superior rights)
position of the aboriginal women of Formosa is due to causes partly
racial, for in Guam, an island of the Marianne, or Ladrone, group
also inhabited by a people evidently of Indonesian extraction, the
same state of affairs seems to exist as regards the relation of
the sexes. In Formosa this certainly is not due to contact with
a superior race, for among both Chinese and Japanese&mdash;as is
generally known&mdash;the woman is regarded as being distinctly
inferior to him who is with these races very literally “lord and
master.”</p>

<p>To whatever cause may be ascribed the dominance of the aboriginal
Formosan woman in both political and religious life&mdash;closely
interwoven as these are&mdash;the result seems to make for the
happiness of all concerned, within the tribal group. Disputes within
the group are of infrequent occurrence. When these do occur, they
are almost always settled either by the queen, or chief-priestess
alone, or by a “palaver” or meeting of remonstrance on
the part of all the elderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127"
id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> women of the group. Theft within the
group seems unknown among any of the tribes; this also applies to
those who are accepted as guests of the tribal group. Guests are
regarded by them as friends, and the fidelity in friendship of these
“Naturv&ouml;lker” is touching; as is also their point of
view regarding the sacredness of a promise. This is especially true of
the Taiyal and the other mountain tribes who have come but little into
contact with either Chinese or Japanese.</p>

<p>Regarding property rights among the Chin-huan (primitive or
“green” savages): all the members of each tribal group
hold in common both hunting-grounds and the grounds used for the
cultivation of millet, sweet potatoes, and tobacco&mdash;and more
recently rice, since this has been introduced by the Japanese. No
dispute in connection with communal property ever seems to arise. It
is understood that each man who is physically able will take part in
the hunting, and thus contribute his share toward keeping the group
supplied with meat. Equally it is understood that every woman not ill
or aged will take part in the cultivation, harvesting, and storing of
food-stuffs. Millet and sweet potatoes are kept in common store-houses,
and&mdash;as explained in another connection&mdash;these are given out
by women who have charge of the store-houses to the woman-head of each
family, as she may have need of them. The scheme of “from each
according to his ability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> to each according to his need”
seems to work successfully and without friction among these people.</p>

<p>The only commodity, apparently, which among them is used as currency
is salt; and this has been recently introduced by the Japanese. Among
those who have never come into contact with the Japanese&mdash;that
is, those in the inaccessible mountain regions&mdash;it is said still
to be unknown.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a
href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>As regards the system of counting in vogue among them, in connection
with barter and otherwise, the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chin-huan</i>&mdash;excluding those of
the Ami and Paiwan tribes, who live on or near the coast, and who have
been for some time in contact with the Chinese and Japanese&mdash;still
count by “hands”: that is, one hand equals five; two hands,
ten, etc. Or, occasionally, by a “man”; the latter, one
learns in time, being equivalent to twenty, that is, the number of
fingers and toes, taken together, belonging to each man.</p>

<p>A striking feature of the social organization of the aborigines
is their strict monogamy and their marital fidelity for the duration
of the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a
href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This custom is in
marked contrast with that of many other primitive races&mdash;Africans,
Australians, Mongols, American Indians: also with that of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> other
Malay and Oceanic peoples, and most of all with that of the Chinese
and Japanese. One of the latter, a government official in Formosa,
with whom I was thrown into contact in connection with my expeditions
into savage territory, pitied the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i> (savages) for not having a
social organization sufficiently highly developed to have room within
it for a <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">geisha</i> system (that of professional singing and dancing
girls) and that of a <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">yoshiwara</i>, the latter term being too well known
in connection with Japanese cities to make explanation or definition
necessary.</p>

<p>Among the “green savages”&mdash;those who have not
come into close touch with the Chinese and Japanese&mdash;adultery
is punished with death, an unfaithful husband suffering the same
punishment as an unfaithful wife; and prostitution is unknown.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> those who have come personally into
contact with a primitive Malay people will, I think, agree that belief
in the “All Father” idea (such as certain anthropologists
suggest is “natural to the child-mind of primitive man”)
does not hold true of this particular branch of primitive man.
Certainly as far as the Formosan aborigines are concerned, there seems
no trace of anything of the sort, except possibly among the Ami, of
the east coast; and such hazy idea of a Supreme Being as they may
perhaps be considered to hold seems probably derived from teachings
of the Dutch missionaries given to their ancestors. When questioned
at all closely as to their religious belief, they speak of several
deities. These are usually in pairs&mdash;male and female&mdash;as
for example Kakring and Kalapiat. These deities seem concerned<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
with the thunderstorms which are frequent on the east coast; these
storms being due, according to Ami belief, to the quarrels between
the god, Kakring, and his wife, Kalapiat; Kakring causing the thunder
by stamping and by throwing about the pots (the latter being the most
prized possession of every Ami house-wife), and Kalapiat bringing about
lightning by completely disrobing herself in her anger&mdash;this
being a method of showing displeasure frequently adopted by Ami women.
Earthquakes&mdash;frequent in Formosa&mdash;are supposed to be caused
by a spirit in the shape of a great pig scratching himself against a
pole, which extends from earth to heaven. Sun, moon, and stars were
created by Dgagha and Bartsing&mdash;god and goddess, respectively. The
earth the Ami believe to be flat; the sun goes under it at night, the
moon and stars under it during the day.</p>

<p>The Ami seem more democratic in religion, as well as in politics,
than the mountain tribes; that is, the theocracy of the priestesses
seems less strong. Priestesses, however, exist among them, and in time
of illness or danger they are asked to intercede with the various
deities. Intercession takes the form of a sort of chanting prayer,
growing louder and wilder as it continues, accompanied by the throwing
into the air of small coloured pebbles (now sometimes glass beads
bartered from Chinese and Japanese), together with small pieces of
the flesh of wild pig&mdash;this apparently as an offering to the
deities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When a tribal group among the Ami is in serious distress or danger,
or faced by the necessity of a decision of importance, the elders
of the group<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>&mdash;or village,
if only one village is affected&mdash;usually repair to a cave,
or to a place near a high cliff&mdash;wherever an echo may be
heard&mdash;accompanied by several priestesses. The latter dance and
chant themselves into a state of frenzy, until they fall exhausted in
a swoon, real or simulated. When they return to consciousness, which
is sometimes not until next day, they say that the spirits which
“sang back” at them from cliff or cave during the chanting
have told them what measures the people must take in order to meet the
emergency in question. This can be communicated only to the elders;
and only the elders are allowed to watch this especially sacred dance.
For any of the younger people to do so would be considered a heinous
sin.</p>

<p>The red stones, or beads, used by the priestesses in their
incantations are also sometimes used by the older warriors and
huntsmen. An old hunter, just before starting into the mountains in
search of game, will put a red pebble into a freshly opened betel-nut,
lay this in the palm of his hand and wave it before his face, palm
upward, toward the sky. This is supposed to bring him good luck in
the chase. The same ceremony is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> been performed in the
olden days, just before starting on a head-hunting expedition.</p>

<p>The ideas of the Ami regarding heaven and hell also suggest that
these may be the vestiges of missionary teachings once given by
the Dutch (the present-day missionaries in Formosa confine their
attention to the Chinese-Formosans as before explained). Good men and
women, the Ami believe, go to “heaven,” and bad ones to
“hell.” Heaven they believe to be situated “somewhere
in the north”; hell “somewhere in the south.” One
wonders if this belief as regards direction represents a tribal
recollection of their former home&mdash;perhaps of a massacre, which
caused the emigration of those remaining; perhaps of hunger, thirst,
and terror on the voyage between the “land to the south”
and Formosa. At any rate, their tradition is that their ancestors
drifted to the coast, which is now their home, in a “long
boat.” The very spot of their debarkation is pointed out&mdash;a
place near Pinan.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a
href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Once a year a
commemoration festival is held at this spot, when food and drink
are offered to the spirits of their ancestors. Their own ancestors
of course have gone to heaven, where they themselves will go after
death; equally of course the people of the other tribes, especially
those with whom they happen to be at enmity, will go to hell (savage
and civilized psychology being on some points strangely alike). The
Ami say, however, that hell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> cannot be any worse than the earth;
otherwise spirits would not remain there.</p>

<p>With the Piyuma&mdash;the small east coast tribe living just south
of the Ami&mdash;the most sacred spot is a bamboo-grove a few miles
inland called by themselves “Arapani.” Here, according to
Piyuma tradition, was planted the staff of a god, which grew into a
bamboo. From different joints of this bamboo sprang the first man and
the first woman, ancestors of the Piyuma people. Markings on a stone
near Arapani are said to be footprints of this first couple. Hence this
stone is considered most sacred.</p>

<p>The tradition of being descended from ancestors sprung from a
bamboo is held by other tribes than the Piyuma; in fact, it is held by
practically all the Formosan tribes; also by the Tagalog tribe of the
Philippines. A similar tradition is referred to in the Japanese tale of
Taketori-Monogatari&mdash;now, I believe, translated into English.<a

    <p class="caption">GLORIFIED ANCESTOR OF THE PAIWAN TRIBE CARVED ON A
SLATE MONUMENT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Paiwan&mdash;the tribe south of the Piyuma&mdash;and indeed
the southernmost of the main island&mdash;is the only aboriginal
tribe that has anything approaching what missionaries would
call “idols”&mdash;that is, carved representations
of deity. Before the house of the chief of every tribal group
among the Paiwan stands an upright block of slate on which is
carved a figure supposed to be human, this figure often being
surrounded by markings <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>representing serpents.<a
name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Both human and serpentine figures are carved
in the slate by means of sharpened flint, or other stone harder than
slate. As the Paiwan also build their houses of slate (by a method to
be spoken of more in detail under the head of <span class="smcap">Arts
and Crafts</span>), representations of human heads and snakes are
carved always on the lintel over the doorway of the chief; and often
on that over the doorways of successful warriors and huntsmen.<a
name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Some anthropologists might see in this frequent representation of
the snake evidence of snake totemism on the part of the Paiwan. I do
not, however, think this is the case. The Paiwan venerate the snake
as being the most dangerous of living creatures (in the tropical
jungles of Formosa there are naturally many deadly species); but
this veneration is more in the nature of theriolatry than totemism.
They seem to think that by having constantly before their eyes
representations of this the most dreaded of all the creatures of the
jungle, they will, through a sort of sympathetic magic, be inspired
with the bravery, as they regard it&mdash;if not the wisdom&mdash;of
the serpent.</p>

<p>As for the figure in human semblance carved on the slate tablet, or
monument, in front of the chief’s house, I am inclined to think
this represents rather a glorified ancestor&mdash;in the sense in which
the Japanese often use the word “Kami<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>” (<a
href="images/i_160fs.png"><img src="images/i_160.png" alt="Chinese
character" /></a>)&mdash;rather than “god” in the Western
sense of that word. Certainly the Paiwan&mdash;like the other
aboriginal tribes&mdash;pay greater reverence to the spirits of
ancestors than to any deity. Besides the ancestral spirits believed
to inhabit the ancient swords or knives, previously referred to,<a
name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a> there are other spirits whose dwelling-place
they believe to be the forest or jungle. All these are worshipped
twice a year, at millet planting time and at harvest, when food
and drink are offered to the spirits of the dead, at the same time
that feasting and drinking are going on among the living; and once
every five years at the time of the harvest festival occurs the
great celebration, when there is played the game of <i lang="pwn" xml:lang="pwn">Mavay aiya</i>,<a
name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> already described.</p>

<p>Adjoining the territory of the Paiwan, on the north-west,<a
name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is that of the Tsarisen. Among the latter
there is a tradition that their ancestors came down from the moon,
bringing with them twelve jars of baked clay, or earthenware. At the
home of the chief of the principal tribal group of this now small
people are kept two or three old baked-clay pots, or jars, believed
by the tribes-people to be of lunar origin&mdash;a remnant of the
original twelve brought down by their ancestors. These of course are
never used, but are regarded by them as being most sacred, only the
chief and the priestesses being allowed to touch, or even to go near,
them. By the side of the old jars is kept<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> a large, circular white
stone, also carefully cherished, believed to be in some way connected
with the moon; but whether it was brought from the moon, or whether its
appearance suggests the full moon, is not clear.</p>

<p>It is before these treasures that the priestesses dance, and also
before them that at the semi-annual festivals they place offerings
of millet and millet wine, also sometimes of fruit and other food,
chanting as they do so. This chanting is supposed to invoke the spirits
of the moon-ancestors, who come down during the ceremony and bestow
blessings upon the tribe. In other groups within the Tsarisen tribe,
where there are no sacred jars or stones, the priestesses arrange the
food-offerings in little piles close together, forming a circle: this
to simulate the full moon. To step within the charmed circle would be
sacrilege unspeakable; an offence so serious that only the death of the
offender, the tribes-people say, would remove from the tribe the blight
that otherwise would fall upon it. It is not on record that any member
of the tribe has ever had the temerity to attempt this; and no member
of any other tribe is allowed to come near the sacred spot.</p>

<p>North of the Tsarisen are the Tsuou and Bunun tribes; the former
a very small tribe, numbering now less than two thousand, the latter
numbering about fifteen thousand, roughly speaking.</p>

<p>The religious belief&mdash;or rather religious ceremonial, for
with primitive people ritual apparently<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> counts for more than
dogma&mdash;of the Tsuou is closely bound up with what is sometimes
called “tree-worship.” That is, within, or very near,
each village there is a certain tree which is regarded as holy; and
once a year&mdash;at harvest-time&mdash;millet wine is sprinkled
near the roots of the tree, and singing, dancing, and feasting
carried on under its branches. I do not consider, however, that this
constitutes true tree-worship, nor do I think that the Tsuou have a
“tree-cult.” Rather, their ceremonial is connected with
ancestor-worship, for they seem to think that the spirits of their
ancestors dwell in the sacred trees, and it is to these spirits that
wine is offered at harvest time, and invocations made.</p>

<p>The Tsuou also regard a certain orchid which grows in that part of
the island as being of peculiar sanctity. They transplant it from the
forest where it grows to the ground at the root of the sacred tree
of each village. During the dry season the priestesses water it, and
always they tend it with scrupulous care. This custom also is obviously
connected with the reverence in which the tribes-people hold their
ancestors, for the latter, they believe, wore this orchid when they
went to battle with neighbouring tribes, and through its magic efficacy
achieved victory. The Tsuou seem to think that in some way this orchid
will eventually restore&mdash;or be instrumental in restoring&mdash;the
former dominance and prosperity of their tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bunun, unlike their neighbours, the Tsuou, regard a certain
kind of tall grass, which grows in the mountainous region in which
they live, as being of even greater sanctity than trees. Twice a
year&mdash;at seed-time and at harvest-time&mdash;great bundles of
this green grass are brought into the houses, millet wine is sprinkled
before the doorway of each house, and invocations to ancestors are sung
and danced in the open, between the houses of each village.</p>

<p>Among the Bunun, as also among all the tribal groups of the
great Taiyal “nation,”<a name="FNanchor_72_72"
id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a> there exists the peculiar custom of starting
a “new fire” at the time of the sowing and harvest
festivals. This “new fire” is ceremonially kindled. At
other times, should the fire go out (though this is considered a thing
of evil omen), or should hunters, away from home, wish to start a fire,
flint-and-steel percussion is used&mdash;this method apparently having
been learned from the Dutch of the seventeenth century, or possibly
from the Chinese. On the ceremonial days of the year, however&mdash;the
days when offerings are made to ancestors&mdash;fire must be kindled by
a method in use in the “days of the fathers.”</p>

<p>Among the Bunun this takes the form of the
“fire-drill”&mdash;the twirling of a pointed stick of hard
wood of some sort in a depression made in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> a stick of softer wood,
until the friction heats the flakes of soft wood, thus “eaten
away,” to a point where flame can be produced by placing against
this hot wood-dust bits of very dry grass or leaves, and blowing
upon it. In order thus to produce fire, the chief of the tribal
group&mdash;among the Bunun usually a man&mdash;shuts himself up alone
in his hut, which for the time being it is tabu for his subjects to
approach, twirling the fire-drill and blowing upon the wood-dust and
tinder, until the sacred fire is “born.” From the flame
thus kindled is lighted first his own domestic fire; then those of
all the other members of the village or group, who, after the actual
kindling of the flame, are invited into the hut of the chief.</p>

<p>The Taiyal method of lighting the sacred fire is a little different
from that employed by the Bunun. Among the Taiyal the duty of producing
the ceremonial “new fire” devolves upon the priestesses.
These “vestals of the flame,” however, are not virgins.
Only middle-aged and elderly women are priestesses; and all those
whom I saw&mdash;or of whom I heard when among the Taiyal&mdash;were
widows, and usually the mothers of children. What becomes of the Taiyal
spinsters one wonders; there seem to be none. Yet they are a strictly
monogamous people; and considering how frequently the men of this tribe
lose their heads&mdash;in a very literal sense&mdash;a disproportion
of women, consequently a number of unmarried ones, might<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
be expected. But this does not seem to be the case, judging both
from my own observation and also from the reply to questions put
to the Japanese <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Aiyu</i> (military police) stationed at various
points among the Taiyal. It may be that those anthropologists<a
name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> are right who hold that the so-called
hardships of savage life&mdash;frequent insufficiency of food,
necessity of hard physical toil on the part of the women, and
similar conditions&mdash;result in a greater number of male infants
being born than is the case under conditions of civilization.<a
name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> (A not impossible hypothesis: since many
stock-breeders hold that the relative leanness or fatness of cattle
has a decided effect upon the sex of the offspring&mdash;“lean
years,” i.e. those of scarcity of food, more males; “fat
years,” those of plenty, more females. This fact&mdash;if it be a
fact&mdash;may also be the basis of the popular idea that shortly after
wars a greater number of males among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i> are born than at
other times.)</p>

<p>However, to return to our muttons&mdash;that of sacred fire, as
produced by the Taiyal. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> ceremonial day when the “new
fire” is to be kindled, the chief priestess of each group
carefully unsheathes her “fire machine” from the wrapping
of bamboo leaves in which it is kept swathed during the greater part
of the year. This “fire machine” consists of two pieces
of bamboo. One piece, used as a saw, is sharpened on one edge to a
knife-like keenness; the other edge is left blunt. This blunt edge is
held in the hand of the officiating priestess. In a shallow groove cut
in the other piece of bamboo the priestess inserts the sharp edge of
the short, wedge-shaped, bamboo saw. To and fro she draws it, chanting
as she does so. Usually she is seated in the open, before the door of
her hut, her congregation of apparently awestruck subjects being seated
in a semicircle, at a respectful distance from her. Gradually the
bamboo saw “eats” down through the other piece of bamboo
across which it is being drawn. The sawdust resulting is as hot as that
which is produced by means of the fire stick, or “drill,”
already described, and by applying to this dust tinder&mdash;very dry
grass, usually&mdash;and by blowing upon it, flame is produced. When
the tinder actually lights, the priestess gives a cry of exultation,
which is echoed by the waiting people; then feasting and dancing
begin.</p>

<p>This kindling of the sacred fire by the Taiyal priestesses occurs
at the time of the celebrations in honour of the spirits of the
ancestors of this tribe. These celebrations take place on the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> night
of the full moon at seed-time and at harvest-time. The day before
“full-moon night,” on these semi-annual occasions, the
people hang balls of boiled millet, usually wrapped in banana leaves,
from the branches of trees, in or near their respective villages.
These are to feed the ancestral spirits, which are supposed to descend
through the air that night, from the high mountain on which they
usually reside, into the trees at the moment of the kindling of the
ceremonial fire. This fire lights the spirits on their way to the
trees, from which the food is suspended&mdash;though moonlight also,
it would seem, is necessary, since these “spirit-feeding”
celebrations among the Taiyal occur always at full-moon time.</p>

<p>In this connection I was much touched on one harvest-time occasion,
when among the Taiyal, at being presented&mdash;by a grizzled warrior,
tattooed with the successful head-hunter’s mark&mdash;with a mass
of boiled millet carefully wrapped in a large banana leaf. This, he
explained, was because he regarded me as a reincarnation of one of the
Dutch “spiritual protectors” of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Reverence for ancestors constitutes almost the whole of
Taiyal religion. None of the people of this tribe&mdash;or
“nation”&mdash;seem to hold a belief in creators of the
universe, such as is held by the Ami. The only deity&mdash;other than
deified ancestors&mdash;whom the Taiyal apparently take into account
is the rain-god, or rather, rain-devil. He, however, is a being very
much to be taken into account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> in a country like that in which the
Taiyal live&mdash;the mountainous part of the island&mdash;where
torrential downpours of such violence sometimes occur during the
rainy season that the bamboo and grass huts of the people are washed
away. The Taiyal are not a people who cringe for mercy at the feet
of deity or devil, any more than at those of Chinese or Japanese.
Therefore, instead of prayers and offerings to propitiate the wrath
or evil temper of the rain-devil, who is supposed to be responsible
for the downpour, the chief priestess and assistant priestesses of
the tribal group that is being inundated gather together, with long
knives in their hands&mdash;these of the sort that are used by the men
in head-hunting&mdash;and begin to dance and gesticulate. The dancing
becomes wilder and more frenzied as it goes on, the gesticulations with
the knives&mdash;thrusting and slashing at imaginary figures&mdash;more
violent; the priestesses cry or chant in a threatening manner, while
the people, both men and women, standing about, howl and wail. Often
the priestesses foam at the mouth in their excitement, their eyes look
as if they would start from their heads, and this knife-dance usually
ends with their falling exhausted in a swoon, throwing their knives
from them as they fall. At this climax the people shout with joy,
declaring that the rain-devil has been cut to pieces; or, sometimes,
that because he has been cut with the knives of the priestesses, he
has fled away and been drowned in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> ponds that he has
been responsible for creating&mdash;being thus destroyed in the
“pit which he had digged for himself.” Whenever the rain
ceases&mdash;as in course of time it inevitably must&mdash;this is
attributed to the warfare which the priestesses have waged against
the rain-devil.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a
href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>After having witnessed the almost maniacal madness of some of these
sacred dances and ceremonies of exorcism on the part of aboriginal
Formosan priestesses, one comes to the conclusion that the so-called
“arctic madness,” of which some anthropologists speak (in
connection with dances and other religious rites of <i>shamans</i> and
medicine-men of the North) is not peculiar to Hyperborean peoples, but
is characteristic of all Mongol and Malay races, when under stress
of religious fervour or other strong excitement. The same habit of
almost hypnotic imitation, one of another, when under stress of terror
or excitement that is said, by those who have been among them, to be
common to sub-arctic peoples, also characterizes the Malay aborigines
of Formosa, this being perhaps particularly noticeable among the Taiyal
tribe.</p>

<p>All groups of the Taiyal hold sacred the small bird to which
reference has already been made <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>in connection with
head-hunting customs&mdash;whose cry is regarded as an omen of good or
evil, according to the note, and followed accordingly. The flight of
this bird is also noted when starting on either a hunting expedition or
on one of warfare (head-hunting). The warriors or hunters will stop on
the spot at which the bird is seen to alight, and there lie in wait for
either enemy or game, according to the nature of the expedition. This
bird cannot, I think, in spite of the reverence in which it is held, be
regarded as the totem of the Taiyal people. Rather, the tribes-people
seem to regard it as the spokesman of some ancestor&mdash;one who was
in his day a famous warrior, and who thus, through the medium of the
bird, continues to guide his descendants, and all members of the tribal
group to which during his lifetime he had belonged. Sometimes it is the
spirit of a priestess which is supposed thus to continue to guide and
guard her people.</p>

<p>The Taiyal word for spirit, or ghost&mdash;often used in the sense
in which the Christian would use guardian angel&mdash;is <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i>. This
seems to correspond with the <i lang="poz" xml:lang="poz">Atua</i> of the Polynesians. Sometimes,
however, it seems to be used much as <i lang="map" xml:lang="map">Mana</i> is used by other Oceanic
peoples. Unless one understands really thoroughly the language of a
primitive people (and I do not pretend so to understand Taiyal) it is
difficult always to trace the association of ideas; but apparently,
in this connection, the association is<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> that when a man is
guided minutely by the spirit of some powerful ancestor, he himself
becomes imbued with more than human power and wisdom and strength.</p>

<p>The heart and the pupil of the eye seem closely associated by the
Taiyal with the spirit of each individual and are sometimes spoken of,
separately and together, as <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i>. The spirit of oneself is thought
to separate itself from one’s body during sleep; also it is
liable to jump out suddenly if one sneezes, and in this case perhaps be
lost permanently; hence a sneeze is considered to portend bad luck.</p>

<p>As regards life after death, the Taiyal believe that only the good
spirits go to the “high mountain,” to which reference has
been made. This local Mount Olympus seems to be situated on one of
the high peaks of the great central mountain range of the island. In
order to reach it&mdash;or to attempt to reach it&mdash;each spirit,
after death, must pass over a narrow bridge spanning a deep chasm. The
men who have been successful as warriors and as huntsmen pass over in
safety; also the women who have been skilful at weaving. Men who have
been unsuccessful in war or in the chase, and women who have lacked
skill at the loom, or have been idle, fall from the bridge down into
the dirty water that lies at the bottom of the chasm.</p>

<p>Most of the Taiyal tribal groups believe&mdash;as do the majority
of the other tribes of the island&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> their ancestors sprang
from the bamboo. But one of the Taiyal sub-groups&mdash;the Taruko,
the “High-cliffs people,” to whom I have already referred
as being of lighter colour and more regular feature than most of the
Taiyal tribes-people&mdash;have a curious legend as to their origin.
They believe that they are the descendants of a princess who was
married to a dog “somewhere over the mountains.” A similar
legend is said to be current among some tribes in Java and Sumatra,
which is not surprising; nor is it surprising that the same belief
should be held by many of the Lu-chu Islanders&mdash;these being
obviously kindred peoples. But an interesting point is that the same
folk-tale is said to exist among certain tribes in Siberia.</p>

<p>The few remaining members of the Saisett tribe have adopted most of
the practices, religious and otherwise, of their powerful neighbours,
the Taiyal; so these need not be considered separately.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the religious beliefs and observances of the
aborigines of the main island.</p>

<p>The Yami&mdash;the tribe living on the tiny
thirty-mile-in-circumference island of Botel Tobago (or “Koto
Sho,” as the Japanese call it), about thirty-five miles
south of Formosa proper&mdash;differ somewhat in religion, as in
other matters, from their neighbours of the large island. The
Yami also observe a semi-annual religious festival; but in their
case the celebration is in honour of the “Sea God,”
offerings of fruit, of food, and of flowers<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> being cast into the
sea on these occasions. No offering of wine is made, as is the
case with the other tribes at their religious festivals, for the
reason that the Yami seem to know nothing of either the making or
the drinking of wine&mdash;one of the few primitive peoples of whom
this is true. They have a tradition that their ancestors “came
up out of the sea”; hence their worship of the “Sea
God”&mdash;a reminiscence probably of the fact that their
ancestors came across the sea from some other island, possibly from
one of the Philippine group, judging from the resemblance of the Yami,
generally speaking, to a Philippine tribe&mdash;that of Batan island.<a
name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>At the time of their celebrations in honour of the “Sea
God” the Yami wear wonderful hats, or helmets, made of silver
coins, beaten thin. These coins they obtain from the Japanese, in
exchange for the products of their own marvellously fertile little
island, when the Japanese boats stop at Botel Tobago, which they now
do once a month. The beaten coins are pierced and strung together
on grass fibres&mdash;or on wires, when these can be obtained
from the Japanese. The stiff bands thus made are built up into
enormous pyramid-shaped head-pieces, worn by both men and women.<a
name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> These constitute the chief article<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> of
dress, the Yami being less skilled in weaving than the aborigines of
the main island, although the women wear garlands of flowers and of
shells.</p>

<p>As the spring festival in honour of the “Sea God” comes
at the time of the vernal equinox, coinciding approximately with the
Christian Easter, the great silver helmets of the Yami can but remind
one of the Easter hats of more civilized lands. And now that the fact
is generally accepted by students of comparative religion and folk-lore
that “Easter” is a pre-Christian festival&mdash;common to
many lands and races, only, at the present time in the Western world,
given an Anno Domini interpretation, as is the case with Christmas and
the other festivals of the Church&mdash;it is perhaps justifiable to
wonder whether the custom of donning gala attire at Easter may not have
a very ancient origin, as many centuries pre-Christian as the festival
itself in celebration of the awakening of the earth to renewed life.</p>

<p>With the Yami&mdash;the Botel Tobago folk&mdash;the New Year is
reckoned from the great spring festival. Most of the tribes on the main
island of Formosa count the New Year as beginning at the time of the
harvest festival in the autumn.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of <span class="smcap">Religion</span>
as this is counted among the aborigines, it may be mentioned that
the seventeenth-century Dutch writers&mdash;Father Candidius
and others&mdash;speak of numerous temples&mdash;“one
to every sixteen houses”&mdash;as existing among the
aborigines. They do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> mention which tribe, or tribes, had
these temples, but the context would seem to imply the Paiwan, or
perhaps the Ami. While these temples doubtless existed at the time that
the Dutch Fathers wrote, they no longer do so. The nearest approach
to a temple is the house of chief or priestess, especially among the
Paiwan, where such carvings as have been described are found. These
carved tablets perhaps represent a system of temples and temple-worship
which once existed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">MARRIAGE CUSTOMS</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>The Point of View of the Aborigines regarding Sex&mdash;Courtship
preceding Marriage&mdash;Consultation of the Bird Omen and of
Bamboo Strips as to the Auspicious Day for the Wedding&mdash;The
Wedding Ceremony&mdash;Mingling by the Priestess of Drops of
Blood taken from the Legs of Bride and Groom; Ritual Drinking
from a Skull&mdash;Honeymoon Trips and the setting-up of
House-keeping&mdash;Length of Marriage Unions.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Turning</span> from the subject of religious
observances to that of marriage customs, one finds the same close
association between the two in Formosa as in other lands. Indeed, the
association is more close than in countries like England and America,
or present-day Russia; since among the aborigines of Formosa there
exists no registry office or other place where a civil marriage can
be performed. In Formosa marriage means always a religious ceremony,
one demanding the presence of the most powerful priestess of the local
group. In some cases, several priestesses take part in the ceremony.
This is especially true of certain of the groups among the Taiyal
tribe, or nation.</p>

<p>Among those tribes, including the Taiyal, that have come least into
touch with alien culture&mdash;Chinese, Japanese, or European&mdash;the
religious side of the marriage ceremony seems to consist largely in
purificatory rites&mdash;rites which tend to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> neutralize, as it
were, the difference between the sexes. Sex is, to the aborigines of
Formosa&mdash;as to many primitive peoples,&mdash;a thing of mystery,
and one fraught with danger&mdash;danger not only to the man and woman
chiefly concerned, but also to the tribal group, or whole tribe. The
welfare or “ill-fare” of the tribal unit is a consideration
which seems always taken into account, even in connection with matters
which people at a different stage of evolution would regard as being
purely personal and private; these primitive folk being in some
respects practical socialists, in spite of the fact that they are under
the domination of a theocracy.</p>

<p>Before going on to speak in detail of the marriage ceremony, it may
be well to say a few words in regard to the courtship which precedes
it.</p>

<p>To one who has never been in the Orient, it may seem a matter of
course that courtship should precede marriage. This, however, is very
far from being the case in most Oriental countries, as all know who
have been “east of Suez.” Certainly both in China and
Japan, marriages are arranged entirely by the parents of the young
people, often with the aid of a professional “go-between,”
the bride and bridegroom-to-be sometimes not even knowing each
other. The idea that a young woman should express any preference on
her own part as to the choice of a husband would be considered most
indelicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, makes it the more surprising that a people not
only geographically so near to China and Japan, but one that is
evidently so closely akin racially to the Japanese&mdash;a fact
that is now recognized by practically all scientific Japanese
ethnologists&mdash;should observe customs of courtship which resemble
those prevailing in the Western world, rather than those characteristic
of the Orient. Nor is this true of one or two tribes only. It is true
of all the tribes of the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chin-huan</i> (“green savages”),
and even also of those sections of the Ami, Piyuma, and Paiwan tribes
that live directly on the east coast, and that have, through contact
with the Chinese, become in other respects partly Sinicized. Their own
customs of courtship and marriage, however, have remained up to this
time intact.</p>

<p>“When a young man’s fancy”&mdash;not lightly, but
seriously, always, in the case of the aborigine&mdash;“turns
to thoughts of love,” he begins to pay court to the maiden of
his choice by going each evening about sunset to her home. Instead,
however, of calling, Occidental fashion, upon the young lady or upon
her parents, he contents himself with&mdash;not exactly sitting upon
her doorstep, since she, in the first place, has no doorstep, and
since he, in the second place, being a Malay, never sits, as we of the
West think of that attitude; but, rather, with squatting in front of
the door-way of her hut and beginning to play upon a bamboo musical
instrument which somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> resembles a jews’-harp, and which
is played in much the same way. The sound produced is, to the Western
ear, more like a wail or lament than like a love-song. However, in
Formosa it is&mdash;as far as the aborigines are concerned&mdash;the
practically universal method of serenading one’s lady-love, and
is apparently enjoyed both by the serenading warrior and by the young
lady. The lover often keeps up the performance for hours at a time, and
returns the next evening, and for many succeeding evenings, to repeat
it. All this time he makes no attempt to pay any other form of address
to the young lady, or to ingratiate himself with her parents. Finally,
after some weeks of this nightly serenading, he leaves the bamboo
jews’-harp one evening at the lady’s door. When he returns
next evening if he finds it still lying there, he knows that his suit
has been rejected; and as in Formosa a woman’s “No”
apparently <em>means</em> “No,” the swain makes no further
attempts to renew the courtship, as far as that particular lady is
concerned. At least, this has been the case as far as my observation
has extended; and apparently to attempt to do otherwise would be one of
the things that is “not done” in the best Formosan society;
the etiquette of primitive peoples being&mdash;as is well known by
those who have been among them&mdash;curiously rigid on many points.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the swain finds that the harp which he left
has been taken into the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> of the young lady, he regards it as
an indication that his suit has been successful, and that he will be
acceptable as a husband to the maiden of his choice. He thereupon
enters the hut, where he is welcomed by the young lady as her formally
betrothed, and by her parents as a future son-in-law.</p>

<p>With the Tsuou tribe, it is customary for the lover to leave an
ornamental hair-pin, called <i lang="tsu" xml:lang="tsu">susu</i>, carved from deer-horn, in front of
the door of his beloved, either in place of the musical instrument or
together with it. The young braves of the Paiwan tribe leave food and
water, as well as the jews’-harp, before the young lady’s
door.</p>

<p>Among the Ami&mdash;or at least among certain tribal groups of
this people&mdash;the devotion of the lover takes a utilitarian turn.
On the night that he begins the musical serenade he brings with
him four bundles of fuel&mdash;wood cut into sticks of convenient
length for burning under the cooking-pots. A number of these
sticks&mdash;such as would form a good armful for a woman&mdash;are
bound together into a bundle, and wrapped about with wild vine. The
four bundles the serenader deposits at his inamorata’s door.
The second night he brings another bundle, which&mdash;on departing
after the serenade&mdash;he adds to those left the night before.
The third night he brings still another; and so on, until a pile of
twenty bundles (never either more or less) stand as a monument<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
testifying to his affection for the lady of his choice. On the night
that the twentieth bundle is added to the pile, the jews’-harp is
also left. This is the night that decides his fate. Next day he returns
to find whether the monument is still standing, or whether the lady, by
using it as firewood, has seen fit to reward his devotion. The wood of
which these bundles are made is always from a tree of a certain kind.<a
name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Two or three of these trees&mdash;young
saplings&mdash;are planted, or transplanted, with certain ceremonies,
by every boy of the tribal groups among whom this fuel-offering custom
exists, when he is about ten years old.</p>

<p>In all cases, and among all the tribes, the acceptance on the part
of the lady of the offerings of the love-lorn swain means acceptance of
himself as a husband.</p>

<p>“What would happen,” I asked several members&mdash;men
and women&mdash;of the Taiyal tribe, “if an engagement were
broken? Would the young lady return the presents?”</p>

<p>“Break an engagement?” They all looked puzzled.
“That would mean breaking a promise that had been made, would it
not? But that is not the custom.” The voice of the priestess, who
was the spokeswoman of the group, was shocked.</p>

<p>“It is a thing not unheard of in some parts of the
world,” I explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158"
id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“I speak not of savages,”<a name="FNanchor_79_79"
id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the old woman disdainfully replied.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the acceptance of the suitor a priestess
is consulted, and she, in turn, consults the bird-omen&mdash;for in
Formosa to-day it is considered quite as true as it was in Greece, in
the days of Hesiod, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>“Lucky and bless’d is he who, knowing all these things,</p>
<p class="i1">Toils in the fields, blameless before the Immortals,</p>
<p class="i1">Knowing in birds and not over-stepping tabus.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Whether or not in Hesiodic Greece birds were supposed to be
mouthpieces of ancestors, I do not know; but certainly this is the case
in present-day Formosa. The ancestors of bride and groom are supposed
to indicate through the cries of birds of a certain species&mdash;the
same species that is consulted on head-hunting expeditions&mdash;the
auspicious day for the wedding.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in order to “make assurance doubly sure,” or
to decide a moot point in regard to the exact day, should there be any
difference of opinion among the priestesses as to the interpretation
of the bird-omen, strips of bamboo, some uncoloured, some blackened
with soot, are thrown by the priestesses into the air. Upon the
way in which these fall&mdash;the relative numbers of blacks and
whites, and also, apparently, upon the pattern that is supposed to be
formed by these strips as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159"
id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> they fall to the ground&mdash;the final
decision as to the day is made.</p>

<p>At the wedding ceremony, bride and groom in their best
regalia&mdash;this on the groom’s part including the successful
warrior’s cap and long knife&mdash;squat in the centre of a
circle formed by relatives and friends. Among most of the tribes the
bride and groom are back to back. A priestess, or more frequently
several priestesses, dance, swaying and chanting, about the young
couple, cutting the air with their knives, to drive away evil spirits,
which would otherwise attack a newly married couple. Before the
knife-dance ends the chief priestess usually makes a slight cut in one
of the legs of both bride and bridegroom, presses out a few drops of
blood from each and mingles this blood on her knife. This also seems
to be done with the idea of neutralizing evil influences that would
otherwise attend the consummation of a marriage.</p>

<p>Feasting and drinking follow the ceremony proper&mdash;or at
least that part of the ceremony just described. The concluding
portion of the ceremony consists in the drinking by bride and groom
together from a skull. This skull is preferably one which has been
taken from an enemy by the bridegroom himself, and among the Taiyal
this is usually the case even to-day. The Bunun and Paiwan often
content themselves with drinking from skulls taken by the father, or
grandfather, of the groom; while the other tribes, especially<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> the
Ami and Piyuma, have so far departed from the ways of their fathers
that a monkey’s skull, or occasionally a deer’s skull, is
now often substituted&mdash;for which effeminacy they are held in great
contempt by the Taiyal.</p>

<p>The newly married couple, among most of the aboriginal tribes of
Formosa, do not live with the parents of either bride or groom, their
custom in this respect also being more in accord with that of the
Occident than with that of most parts of the Orient.</p>

<p>After marriage they “set up housekeeping” for
themselves, in a bamboo or stone hut, according to the tribe.<a
name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a> As a matter of fact, among the Taiyal,
the newly married couple seem often to retire into the forest
or jungle for several days after the marriage ceremony,<a
name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and only upon their return from this
sylvan honeymoon does the bridegroom build the hut, while the
bride has her face tattooed by the priestesses with the insignia
of matronhood&mdash;a design which extends from lip to ear, and
which will be described at greater length under the head of <span
class="smcap">Tattooing</span>. The Taiyal women, alone, have
their faces tattooed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> at puberty and at marriage. Among the
other tribes the state of matronhood seems to be designated by the
wearing of a turban, or head-cloth.</p>

<p>The Piyuma tribe presents the only exception to the rule that after
marriage young people are expected to set up house-keeping on their own
account. In this tribe, which is matrilocal, as well as matripotestal,
the bridegroom transfers himself and all his belongings to the home
of the bride, and is thenceforth known as a member of her family.<a
name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Among none of the tribes did I find evidence of exogamy&mdash;in
the usually accepted sense of that word. The regulations restricting
the marriage of near relatives are, however, rigid. Marriage of first
cousins is forbidden; or rather it is “frowned upon,” as
regards the marriage of cousins on either side of the family. But among
the Ami, Piyuma, Tsarisen, and Paiwan tribes marriage with the first
cousin on the mother’s side is absolutely forbidden. Among the
other tribes it is marriage with the first cousin on the father’s
side that is strictly tabu. Nor does it ever seem to occur to the young
people even to attempt to defy these tribal tabus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"
id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding the permanency of marriage-unions. Among the
“Savages of the North”&mdash;the Taiyal and
Saisett&mdash;the separation of husband and wife is almost unknown,
with the exception of those few unions, already referred to, where
the woman is apparently of mixed pigmy blood. With the tribes of the
South, however, separation is more frequent, based apparently&mdash;in
many cases certainly&mdash;on “mutual incompatibility.” In
such cases the separation is usually a peaceful one, both husband and
wife frequently remarrying. It is among the Ami that the frequency of
separation and remarriage reaches its height, marriages in this tribe
often not lasting more than two years; that is, among young people. A
marriage that occurs between people of thirty-five years or over (in
which case, naturally, according to the custom of this tribe, both have
been married before) is usually a lasting one.</p>

<p>The children of temporary unions, such as have been described, go
sometimes with one parent, sometimes with the other. The arrangement
seems always an amicable one, the grandparents of the children
often deciding the matter. Priestesses are also usually consulted
on this point, as on others that affect either individual or tribal
welfare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">CUSTOMS CONNECTED WITH ILLNESS AND DEATH</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>Belief that Illness is due to Evil <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i>&mdash;Ministrations
of the Priestess&mdash;A Seventeenth-century Dutch Record of
the Treatment of the Dying by the Formosan Aborigines&mdash;The

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> on occasions of
rejoicing&mdash;marriage, harvest-festivals, celebration of successful
war or hunting expeditions&mdash;so in times of sorrow&mdash;illness
or death&mdash;are the ministrations of the priestesses in demand.
Illness&mdash;except that which is the direct result of wounds received
in foray or battle&mdash;is regarded as being due to the machinations
of the malevolently inclined, living or dead. That is, it may be a
living enemy whose evil and powerful <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> causes pain and illness;
or it may be the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of the ghost of some dead enemy. Serious
illness is more usually attributed to the latter, since the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i>
of a ghost is considered to have more power than that of any living
person.</p>

<p>Naturally the element of terror enters into such a conception;
also that of helplessness, since against an enemy already
dead there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> reprisal. The advantage is all on the
side of the dead man&mdash;an auto-suggestion which tends, of course,
to aggravate the illness of the living.</p>

<p>In any case of illness a priestess is summoned. The usual mode of
procedure on the part of this lady is first to wave a banana-leaf
over the patient, chanting as she does so. This is evidently to brush
away&mdash;or frighten away&mdash;any evilly inclined <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> that
may be hovering about. Then, squatting by the side of the sufferer,
she begins to suck at that spot on his&mdash;or her&mdash;body where
the patient complains of greatest pain, and to breathe upon it; now
and then she stops sucking, and rocks herself to and fro, as she
balances on her heels, chanting in time to the rocking motion. If
it be suspected that the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of a living enemy has caused the
illness, the priestess will throw into the air her strips of black
and white (i.e. natural-coloured) bamboo, and upon the pattern
formed by these, as they fall, will depend her decision as to who is
responsible for the illness of the patient. The guilty person will
thereupon be hunted down by relatives of the ill man or woman,<a
name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and a blood-feud will result, for illness or
suffering caused by the living can be cured only by the death of the
one responsible.</p>

<p>Should the priestess decide, however, that it is<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of a ghost which has caused the trouble, then only
“prayer and fasting” can avail&mdash;or can be tried,
the prayer taking the form of chanting, which often becomes wild and
hysterical, the priestess sometimes rising to her feet and dancing
as she chants. Apparently the point of the chanting is to invoke the
ghosts of the ill man’s ancestors, and to beseech these to
overcome the ghost of his enemy. If, by chance, the patient survives
the sucking and chanting, and recovers, his recovery is of course
attributed to the intercession of the priestess.</p>

<p>Among many of the sub-tribes&mdash;or tribal groups&mdash;of the
Taiyal, especially those living in the eastern part of the Taiyal
territory, the officiating priestess, in cases of serious illness,
attempts to learn the decision of the ghost-ancestors, as to whether
they will restore the patient to health, or whether they consider it
time for him to join themselves. This she does by grasping tightly
between her knees a bamboo tube which projects in front; on this tube
she balances a stone with a hole pierced through it&mdash;an object
which is considered sacred. Above this sacred object she waves her
hands. If the stone remains balanced on the bamboo, it is thought the
patient will recover. If it drops to the ground, it is believed that
the ancestors have determined to call the ill man to themselves.</p>

<p>In any case, if death is seen to be inevitable, relatives
and friends of the dying man gather<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> about his
bedside and “wail his spirit across the bridge.”<a
name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The Dutch writers of the seventeenth century state that among
certain of the aborigines of Formosa (which tribe is not specified) it
was the custom to take the very ill man out of his hut, bind a rope of
vegetable fibre or twisted vines about his body, and by means of this
rope suspend him to the bent-down spring-branch of a tree, then release
the branch, which release would have the effect of throwing the dying
man violently to the ground, thus “breaking his neck and all
his limbs.” The aborigines told the Dutch that they did this in
order to shorten the suffering of the dying. But the Dutch missionary
Fathers, who claimed to have witnessed this peculiar act of barbarity,
seemed to think the real motive which actuated those responsible was to
save themselves the trouble of tending the ill and dying.</p>

<p>To whatever extent this custom may have prevailed in the days of the
Dutch occupation of the island, it is, I think, no longer observed,
either among the Taiyal nation of the North or among any of the various
tribes of the South. Whether or not the giving up of this practice
among those tribes where it formerly existed was due to the influence
of the Dutch missionaries, I do not know. If so, it seems never to
have been resumed. Among the tribes of both the North and the South,
at the present time, the ill and dying are<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> tended by priestesses
and wailed over by members of the family&mdash;and, if a person
of prominence, by other members of the village or community as
well&mdash;until the breath has left the body.</p>

<p>After death there is a difference among the tribes as to the
disposition of the body. With the Taiyal&mdash;also the Saisett,
the smaller tribe of the North which seems to have borrowed Taiyal
customs&mdash;the dead man or woman is simply left in the house which
was his, or her, abode during life. In the case of a man, the weapons
which he used during life, also pipe and tobacco, are left with the
body; in the case of a woman, agricultural implements&mdash;hoe or
digging-stick&mdash;and tobacco are left. The loom which she used, for
some reason, is not left. This distinction&mdash;between agricultural
implements and loom&mdash;apparently is made because the former is
regarded as belonging exclusively to the individual woman, while the
latter is used communally by a number of women of the village. At least
such is the explanation given; but one cannot help wondering to what
extent considerations of a practical nature enter into the distinction
made, since a digging-stick or hoe, such as is used by Taiyal women,
can be made in much less than a day, while it requires many days of
labour to make a loom.</p>

<p>With the bodies of both men and women a little food and wine are
left&mdash;a share in the funeral feast, which is partaken of by every
adult member of the village, including the nearest relations of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> the
deceased, whose appetites do not seem to be affected by their loss.</p>

<p>In all the “dead-houses” that I have seen the roof has
been broken in. This I am told is done by the funeral party at the time
that they abandon the house; but whether by thus covering the corpse
with the broken-in roof&mdash;bamboo and grass&mdash;the intention is
to save the body from desecration by dogs or other animals, or whether
it is to prevent the spirit of the dead man from quitting the house
in which his body has been left, is an open question. Certainly the
living seem to stand much in dread of the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of the recently
deceased. This was impressed upon me more than once when I attempted
to go near one or another of these abandoned houses of the dead. I was
gently drawn back and made to understand that I was running very grave
danger.</p>

<p>As the Taiyal houses are built only of bamboo and of a sort of
coarse grass which grows in the mountains, the erection of a new house
for the family of the deceased is not a serious undertaking; more
especially as all the men of the village assist at the building of
the new house, which is always erected at a respectful distance from
the one that has been given over to the dead. The new house is often
erected in a single day.</p>

<p>It may be that the difference in the style of
houses&mdash;consequently in the amount of time and labour involved
in their construction&mdash;accounts<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> for the difference in
burial customs between the Taiyal, on the one hand, and certain of
the southern tribes, notably the Paiwan and a portion of the Ami and
Bunun, on the other. Those of the Ami who live immediately on the
coast, in the vicinity of Chinese villages, have adopted the Chinese
custom of inhumation of the dead outside the house; but those who
live inland from the coast follow what was evidently their original
custom, as it is still that of the Paiwan and the eastern Bunun;
namely, the burial of the dead, in a crouching position, underneath the
hearth-stone of the family home. Gruesome as the custom may seem to
Western minds&mdash;and unhygienic&mdash;it is accepted as a matter of
course by the tribes among whom it exists, and the idea of its exciting
horror in the mind of anyone else seems to them incredible and absurd.
The houses of the people who practise this peculiar form of inhumation
are substantially built of slate (the mode of construction to be
described in greater detail under a subsequent heading); one or more
slabs of slate being used as a hearth, on which a fire is kept always
burning&mdash;or, during the dry season, smouldering.</p>

<p>When the death occurs of any member of the family, the body is
bound with strands of coarse grass in a stooping, or crouching,
posture. Then after the usual funeral ceremonies, both of wailing
and of feasting, are concluded, the ashes are scraped from the
hearth&mdash;care being taken, however,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> that the coals are kept
“alive,” for should these be extinguished, or grow cold, it
would be considered an omen of evil, and would also “displease
the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i>” of the dead&mdash;and the hearth-stones are
removed. A deep hole is dug in the place from which the stones have
been moved. This is usually lined with grass before the body is lowered
into it. The personal belongings of the deceased are also placed in the
grave, which is then filled in, the hearth-stone replaced, and the fire
rekindled. Then the life of the surviving members of the household goes
on as before.</p>

<p>After several members of the household have died, naturally the
space occupied by the graves extends beyond that covered by the
hearth-stones, but always the graves are grouped as closely as
possible beneath the hearth. Whether originally this was done that
the heat of the fire might the more quickly decompose the bodies
I do not know. At the present time the only reason given for this
custom is the stereotyped one, “Thus have our fathers always
done”&mdash;an answer which makes one wonder, in connection with
many customs, at what point in evolution man ceased to be satisfied
with this reason for doing, or leaving undone, the things which make up
the routine of his life.</p>

<p>The funeral customs of the western Bunun&mdash;or of certain
communities among them&mdash;are reminiscent of the customs,
described by the Dutch Fathers, as having been in vogue among<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the aborigines in their day. Among these people&mdash;the western
Bunun&mdash;the dead receive both a “green” and a
“dry” funeral. After death the body is slowly dried for
nine days before a fire in the house in which the deceased died,
funeral festivities being continued by the living during this time.
This process is said partially to mummify, or desiccate, the body (I
have not myself been present at such a funeral). At the end of the
ninth day, the body is wrapped in cloths and placed on a platform in
the open, similar to that on which the dead of the American Indians of
the western plains are placed. This platform is also draped about with
native cloth. At the end of three years, the bones are removed from the
platform and buried beneath the house which the man had occupied during
his lifetime. This second, or “dry,” funeral is, like
the first, or “green” one, made an occasion for drinking
and feasting&mdash;an essential part of every ceremony, whether of
rejoicing or of sorrow. After the “dry” funeral, the widow,
or widower, of the deceased is considered free to contract another
alliance, should he, or she, feel so inclined. To remarry before the
“dry” funeral, three years after the death of the deceased,
would be contrary to tribal custom; therefore one of the things that is
never done.</p>

<p>Among none of the tribes of the Formosans did I see any evidence
of the wearing of the bones of the deceased as an indication of
mourning&mdash;as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> the case in certain parts of Indonesia.
Nor is there anything approaching “suttee,” or the
sacrifice, in any form, of the widow at the death of her husband.
This, however, would scarcely be expected in a country where women
“hold the upper hand,” as is apparently the case in
Formosa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> deal adequately with this subject
would require a volume in itself. In this book I shall speak only
of those forms of arts and crafts which are either peculiar to the
Formosans or which seem to show their racial affinity to other
peoples.</p>

<p>First, as regards their dwelling-houses. The mode of construction
of these varies among the different tribes, and has already
been referred to in the preceding chapter, in connection with
funeral rites. The houses of the Taiyal&mdash;simple bamboo
and grass shelters, having only a doorway, but no windows<a
name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;call for little in the way of detailed
description. These huts are mere sleeping-places, the beds being
bamboo benches, built against the sides of the wall, at about two feet
elevation from the ground. Only in rainy weather is either cooking
or weaving done inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"
id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> the house. The interior of the hut is in
almost total darkness, the doorway being both narrow and low; so low
that even a woman has to stoop in order to enter it. The smaller tribes
whose territory adjoins that of the Taiyal also build huts after the
fashion of their more powerful neighbours.</p>

<p>The Ami folk, certainly those living on, or near, the coast,
substitute roughly hewn planks or small saplings for bamboo. This may,
perhaps, be due to Chinese influence.</p>

<p>The houses of the Bunun and Paiwan are much more substantial, and
are constructed on an altogether different principle, these houses
being of the “pit-dwelling” type. With these tribes it
is to <em>dig</em> a house, rather than to <em>build</em> one, since a larger
portion of the structure is below ground than above it. A space
about ten feet by twelve is cleared of trees and jungle growth, and
a pit is dug. This pit is usually between four and five feet deep.
The sides of the pit are lined with slabs of slate, quarried by the
tribesmen. These slate walls are carried up about three feet above
the surface of the earth, thus giving a wall-height to the house of
about seven feet. For the roof bamboo poles are first laid across from
wall to wall, then on top of these are placed other slabs of slate,
giving the house a substantial, but rather cave-like, appearance.<a
name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"
class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The effect upon a stranger entering a
Paiwan village is to make him wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> first whether he has
been transported into a land of gnomes, and secondly&mdash;and more
seriously&mdash;whether or not the gnome-tradition may have arisen from
a subterranean-dwelling people similar to the present-day Paiwan.</p>

<p>In all probability the slate pit-dwellings were originally
constructed as places of refuge from the warlike, predatory tribes
of the North; and judging from the number of enemy skulls in Paiwan
villages, these slate refuges were effective. Curiously enough,
however, the “bachelor-houses,” in which the young
unmarried men live, are built of wood, on high piles, or stakes. The
mode of entry to these bachelor-houses has already been described.<a
name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The young men are supposed to have at
least one of their number constantly on guard, in order to detect
the possible approach of an enemy. In such an event a warning is
given, when the women and children retreat within the slate houses.
The married men also repair to their houses, but only long enough
to collect their arms; when, having done so, they sally forth to
join the bachelors in an attack upon the enemy. Only, as a last
resort, when hard pressed by the enemy, do the men&mdash;in such an
emergency, bachelors as well as married men&mdash;retreat within the
slate huts and, firing through doors and windows, attempt to keep
the enemy at bay. Among the Paiwan the house of a chief has usually
three windows, and the house of a commoner always one, sometimes<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> two;
consequently this mode of “aggressive defence” is often
successful.</p>

<p>Among the peace-loving Yami&mdash;the inhabitants of the tiny island
of Botel Tobago&mdash;slate houses are not found. Family houses, as
well as the “long-houses” of the bachelors, are of the
“pile-dwelling” variety.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption">PAIWAN VILLAGE OF SLATE.</p>
  <p class="caption"><i>The houses are of the pit-dwelling variety; a
larger portion of each house is below ground.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However the dwelling-houses of the different tribes may vary, the
millet granaries of all the tribes seem built after an identical
pattern. There is in each village of every tribe a communal
granary&mdash;a hut, built sometimes of wood, sometimes of bamboo, but
always supported on pillars, some five or six feet above the ground.
Near the top of each of the four pillars is a round piece of wood
(among the Paiwan slate is sometimes substituted for wood) supposed to
prevent rats and mice “and such small deer” from entering
the granary.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a
href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">rokko</i>,
as the Taiyal call the “rat-preventer” (to translate
literally), is found in the granaries and store-houses of many
of the Oceanic peoples&mdash;both in the Lu-chu Islands and in
certain parts of Melanesia; a coincidence which is not surprising.
It is, however, rather surprising to find the same device used
among the Ainu of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Hokkaido and Saghalien. This fact tends
rather to upset one’s theory that the culture of the Formosan
aborigines is of purely Indonesian origin&mdash;unless perhaps one
accepts the hypothesis that in this instance the Ainu have borrowed a
custom from their southern neighbours; or again, unless it be a case
of “independent origin,” a discussion of the pros and cons
regarding which theory cannot be attempted here.</p>

<p>Far more remarkable than the dwelling-houses or granaries of the
Formosan aborigines are the long suspension-bridges, which with
marvellous skill they construct of bamboo, held together only with
deer-hide thongs, or occasionally with tendrils of a curiously tough
vine growing in the mountains, and throw across the deep chasms and
ravines which abound in the interior of the island, especially in
the mountainous section inhabited by the Taiyal, Bunun, and Paiwan
tribes. These bridges are now imitated by the Japanese, as regards
shape and construction. Only the material is different, galvanized iron
and wire being substituted for bamboo and thongs. Ingenious bamboo
fences are also constructed by the Taiyal, surrounding their village
communities.</p>

<p>The weapons of the men, bow and arrows and knives, have
been referred to before. Both knives and arrow-heads were
formerly made of flint, but for many years iron has been used<a
name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178"
id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> this being obtained by barter, until
recently from the Chinese and now usually from the Japanese. The few
old stone knives still remaining among them are regarded as sacred, and
are used by the priestesses in warding off evil <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> at marriage
ceremonies and on occasions of illness&mdash;as has been described in
preceding chapters. The knives are not of the wavy “kris”
variety used by some of the Malay peoples, but have one curve, the
cutting edge being on the convex side of this curve. The scabbard
of this knife consists of a single piece of wood hollowed out to
fit the blade. Across the hollowed-out portion are fastened twisted
thongs of deer-skin or strips of bamboo, or&mdash;when these can be
obtained&mdash;strips of tin, which hold the knife in place when it
is sheathed. Old tomato-cans and milk-tins are now eagerly sought for
this purpose, and much in the way of game and millet will be offered
for them. The scabbard of a chieftain or of an honoured and successful
warrior is decorated with coloured pebbles set into the wood; or, in
the case of the Ami, who live near the sea-shore, with bits of shell or
of mother-of-pearl. The handle of the knife is bound around with wire,
when this can be obtained. Wire is considered highly ornamental, and is
greatly prized, and eagerly bargained for. It is used for ornamenting
pipes as well as knives, and is also bound about the arms, and worn
as bracelets by both women and men; besides being worn as ear-rings
by the men&mdash;twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> into huge rings, and thrust through
holes in the lobes of the ears.</p>

<p>The intimately personal tool of each woman is her millet-hoe,
which has already been described.<a name="FNanchor_91_91"
id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But the pride of the woman of each household
is the loom belonging to that household. The construction of this loom
can be better understood by looking at the accompanying illustration
of a Taiyal woman at her loom than by detailed description. Broadly
speaking, the loom is of the Indonesian type, but the trough-like
arrangement&mdash;the hollowed-out log, around which the warp is
wrapped&mdash;seems to have been evolved in Formosa alone; I do not
know of its occurring elsewhere in Indonesia, or in Melanesia or
Polynesia.</p>

<p>The textile that is woven on this loom is made from a sort of
native hemp, which grows in the mountains. The only colouring matter
obtainable for dyeing the hemp is the juice of a tuber also indigenous
to the mountains. This tuber somewhat resembles a very large and rather
corrugated potato. The dye obtained from this tuber is of chocolate
colour. It is the custom to weave the textile in stripes, uncoloured
and dyed strands alternating. The effect is not displeasing, and
the material is very strong, lasting for years, and withstanding
almost any strain.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a
href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> None of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the tribes, however, are satisfied with the subdued shade which
their native dye gives; and most of them have for years obtained,
through barter, cheap Chinese blankets of brilliant crimson, which
they carefully ravel, and with the yarn thus obtained they add
fanciful designs in the weaving of their cloth. Much ingenuity
is displayed in these designs, which often express a sense of
the genuinely artistic, as well as the merely fantastic.<a
name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Besides the cloth that is woven on looms, the women also make
net-bags, by means of a bamboo shuttle and mesh-gauge, not unlike
those used by American Indian women of the western plains&mdash;only
the shuttle and mesh-gauge of the latter are made of wood instead of
bamboo. These bags are of two sizes, the larger for carrying millet and
other provisions, the smaller just large enough to hold a human head.
It is often upon bags of this latter kind that the greatest amount of
time and of ingenuity is expended. Every warrior has one of these bags.
Next to his knife, it is his most treasured possession, one which he
always takes with him when going upon a head-hunting expedition. If
successful, the head of his enemy is brought back in it.</p>

  <p class="caption">AUTHOR IN THE DRESS OF A WOMAN OF THE TAIYAL TRIBE.</p>
</div>

<p>A woman who is not a good weaver or maker of bags is held in
contempt by the other women, as well as by the men; and as previously
stated&mdash;in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>the chapter dealing with <span
class="smcap">Religion</span>&mdash;it is believed that such a woman
after death will not be able to cross the bridge which leads to the
land of happiness&mdash;that occupied by her more skilful sisters and
by successful head-hunters. This feeling seems especially strong among
the Taiyal people.</p>

<p>In basketry and in the making of caps&mdash;a cap in Formosa being
only a sort of inverted basket with a visor&mdash;the women are as
skilful as in the weaving of cloth. This applies to all the tribes.
Among the Paiwan, the cap of the successful warrior&mdash;and now
sometimes of the successful huntsman&mdash;is decorated in front, just
above the visor, with a sort of rosette of wild boar’s tusks.
This is a symbol of honour as significant among the Paiwan as is the
tattoo-mark on the chin of the successful warrior among the Taiyal.</p>

<p>While both in the weaving of cloth and of baskets&mdash;including
basket-caps&mdash;the various tribes stand much on a level, there is
great difference in skill as regards the making of pottery. In this
art the Ami stand pre-eminent among the tribes on the main island.<a
name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Their pots, however, are crude as compared
with those of some of the peoples of the South Pacific. The Ami
do not use the coiling process in the making of pottery, nor do
they use a potter’s wheel. Their pots are first fashioned
roughly by hand; then, while the clay is still soft, a round stone,
held in the left hand, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> inserted into the interior of the pot.
Around this the pot is twirled with the right hand; rather, with a
small paddle-like stick held in the right hand. This may perhaps be
called an approximation to the potter’s wheel. At any rate, the
finishing touches are given with the paddle-shaped stick, which is used
for smoothing and making symmetrical the exterior and interior of the
vessel. The pot is then dried in the sun, and afterwards baked in a
fire usually made of straw, i.e. dried mountain grass of a particular
kind.</p>

<p>The Yami of Botel Tobago are skilful pottery-makers, their pots
recalling in appearance those of the Papuans; but the other tribes
are crude and clumsy in their attempts at the making of pots. These
are roughly fashioned by hand, and, as they constantly break, are
apparently not sufficiently baked before being used. Consequently for
carrying water most of the tribes now use tubes of the great bamboo
that grows in Formosa. For cooking they use baskets coated inside and
out with clay, as a substitute for pots.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the skilful making of pottery was
once an art more widely spread among the different tribes than is
the case at present. Among many of the tribes there is a tradition
that their ancestors were mighty in the making of “vessels
moulded from earth.” The Tsarisen not only have this tradition,
in common with the other tribes, but also they have kept among them
for many generations&mdash;just how long<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> there is no means of
ascertaining&mdash;a few pots more skilfully made than this tribe is
capable of making at the present time. These, they assert, were made
by their ancestors, who, in turn, were taught by the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of their
own ancestors. These pots are regarded as being most sacred, and are
kept in front of the house of the chief of the principal tribal unit.
So sacred are these particular pots that only the chief, or members
of his immediate family, and the chief priestess of that tribal unit,
are allowed to touch them. It is <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">parisha</i> (tabu) for anyone else to
touch or even to come within a “body’s length” of
the sacred vessels. In Formosa&mdash;except among the Ami and the Yami
tribes&mdash;as in Polynesia, skilful pottery-making seems to be an art
that is rapidly dying out.</p>

<p>Implements connected with the harvesting and preparation of
millet&mdash;a short curved knife for cutting, formerly made of
flint, now usually of iron, a winnowing-fan of basket-work, and
mortar and pestle of wood&mdash;are not dissimilar to those used by
other Malay peoples; nor are they unlike those used by the Chinese
and Japanese in the harvesting and winnowing of rice. The aborigines,
however, except those who have come directly under Chinese and
Japanese dominance, look with contempt upon rice-eaters as being
unclean&mdash;much as the latter regard eaters of beef and potatoes.
All tribes among the aborigines seem to regard millet as a sacred
food, the use of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> was revealed to their ancestors by
“further away God-ancestors.”</p>

<p>The agricultural implements of the east coast Ami show greater skill
of manufacture than those of the other tribes, this perhaps being due
to contact with the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Ami living on, or near, the coast also make&mdash;and
successfully use&mdash;an ingenious fish-trap of bamboo having on the
interior sharp spikes or thorns, pointing inward. These act as barbs,
and prevent the fish which have entered the basket-like trap from
leaving it.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the bamboo jews’-harp,
an instrument which seems common to all the tribes. Besides this,
the Taiyal and Tsuou tribes have two other musical instruments, the
nose-flute and the musical bow. It is possible that these may be used
by other tribes, but I think not commonly so; certainly I have not
found them elsewhere than among the Taiyal and Tsuou. And with these
tribes the nose-flute is used only by the men; it seems semi-sacred
in character, as it is played only on festive occasions, usually when
celebrating a victory over another tribe or tribal unit. Not even a
priestess will play upon a nose-flute; to do so would be “bad
form.” Playing upon this instrument is the exclusive prerogative
of the sterner sex&mdash;as much so as is the decapitation of enemies,
with the celebration of which it seems closely connected.</p>

<p>The musical bow also is usually played by men,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
although priestesses occasionally use it as an accompaniment to their
chanting during ceremonials connected with harvest festivals, and on
similar occasions.</p>

<p>In the way of personal adornment, women of all the tribes wear, in
addition to the wire bracelets which have previously been referred to,
necklaces made of small rectangular bits of bone, carefully polished
and strung together on sinews. These bits of bone are usually cut
from the femur of the tiny Formosan deer, with which the mountains
abound. The Yami women also wear necklaces made of seeds, and sometimes
of shells.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a
href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The most conspicuous adornments of the women, however, are the
tubes of bamboo inserted through holes cut in the lobes of the ears;
brightly coloured yarn&mdash;when this can be obtained; when not, dried
grass&mdash;being thrust into the bamboo, forming a sort of rosette at
each end of the ear-tube. This is considered highly ornamental by the
tribes-people; the larger the bamboo that the lobe of the ears will
support without being torn through, the more is its owner admired.</p>

<p class="center">TATTOOING AND OTHER FORMS OF MUTILATION</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>Cutting away of the Lobes of the Ears and knocking out of the
Teeth&mdash;Significance of the Different Designs of Tattoo-Marking
among the Taiyal&mdash;Tattooing among the Paiwan.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> form of mutilation&mdash;that
of perforating the lobes of the ears&mdash;was referred to in the
last chapter. “Perforating,” however, inadequately
describes the cutting away of the major portion of the ear-lobe,
leaving only a thin circle of flesh through which is thrust the
bamboo ear-plug. As previously described, the bamboo tube is, in
the case of women, decorated by having strands of yarn, or of dried
grass, threaded through it; this being twisted to form a rosette at
either end of the bamboo. Men also wear the bamboo ear-plug, but I
have never seen the ear-plug of a man decorated with rosettes.<a
name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Masculine vanity, as regards the ear, seems
to take a different form&mdash;that of having rings of wire twisted
through the hole in the lobe, between the bamboo ear-plug and the
rim of flesh beneath it, so that these<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> “ear-rings”
hang from the ear, sometimes jingling as the wearer walks, if he be
fortunate enough to secure enough wire to make several rings for each
ear. This added weight of the rings of wire depending from the lobe
of the ear, which has already been cut to a thin strip&mdash;to allow
the passage through it of the bamboo plug&mdash;sometimes causes the
flesh to tear through. The man to whom such an accident happens meets
with little sympathy; he is regarded as a weakling, and treated with
consequent scorn.</p>

<p>The most painful form of mutilation, however, common among all
the tribes except the Ami, is the knocking out of the two upper
lateral incisor teeth. This constitutes a sort of puberty ceremony,
being performed upon both boys and girls when they reach the age of
thirteen or fourteen. Among the Taiyal, the teeth&mdash;instead of
being knocked out with wooden blocks, as is common among the other
tribes&mdash;are often extracted with twisted China grass, or with a
strand from a loom of one of the women of the tribe. This ceremony
is usually performed by a priestess, though among some of the tribal
units the honour of performing the dental ceremony is conferred upon
a valiant and successful warrior. The reason given for extracting
the teeth of youths and maidens is that, as these are now no longer
children, they must cease to resemble monkeys and dogs, which have
not the wisdom to remove their teeth. As, however, the same custom
exists among practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> all primitive peoples, the explanation
given is a dubious one, and is obviously “thought up” for
the sake of satisfying the curiosity of the white man, or woman, who is
foolish enough to want to know the “reason why” of customs
that all sensible and well-brought-up people follow as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>Tattooing is a form of mutilation that is followed by the two large
tribes of Taiyal and Paiwan; the small tribe of Saisett imitating the
system in vogue among the Taiyal; the Tsarisen and Piyuma imitating
that of the Paiwan. The Taiyal system is the most distinctive, and
seems to have the greatest significance as indicating the status of
the individual in the tribe. The tattooing of the Taiyal is on the
face. When a child&mdash;whether boy or girl&mdash;reaches the age of
about five, it has tattooed on its forehead a series of horizontal
lines, each line being about half an inch in length. These lines are
repeated, one above another, from a point between the eyebrows to one
just below the roots of the hair; the design when finished giving the
impression of a finely striped rectangle about half an inch in width
and two and a half inches in height. Usually several children are
tattooed at the same time, and the occasion is made one of feasting
and dancing. The children are by this ceremony formally accepted as
members of the tribe, entitled to its rights and privileges, and also
expected to bear some share of its duties and responsibilities.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> It is
usually at this time that a boy is made to lay his hand upon the head
of an enemy decapitated by his father&mdash;a custom to which reference
has previously been made.</p>

<p>A Japanese lecturer in a paper read before the China Society in
London in 1916&mdash;and afterwards published&mdash;said, in speaking
of the Taiyal: “When a boy attains the age of five or six
he tattoos on his forehead a series of three blocks of horizontal
lines,” etc. “A girl also tattoos her forehead at the same
age.”</p>

<p>It was probably the English of the lecturer in question that
was at fault, not his knowledge of the subject. As a matter of
fact, no child tattoos itself. It is always an adult&mdash;usually
a priestess&mdash;who tattoos the child. The latter reclines upon
the ground; the tattooer stands behind the child and strikes
its forehead with a tattooing implement. This is a piece of
bamboo&mdash;occasionally wood&mdash;with a number of thorns (from
six to ten) fastened at one end, somewhat resembling a miniature
toothbrush.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a
href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Often a block of
wood is held in the tattooer’s other hand, and with this
the tattooing implement is struck after it has been laid upon the
forehead; this ensures a stronger blow, and one more accurately
placed. It seems necessary that blood be drawn; this is wiped away,
and into each puncture a sort of native lamp-black&mdash;obtained
by burning oily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190"
id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> nuts&mdash;is rubbed; the effect is to
produce lines in the design described above.</p>

<p>The same method is employed by the priestess in tattooing the
bride&mdash;a custom to which reference was made in the chapter dealing
with <span class="smcap">Marriage Customs</span>. In this case,
however, the tattooing is done upon the cheeks, and in a design quite
different from that which is made upon the forehead of the child. The
design that indicates matronhood is one that practically covers both
cheeks, extending from the mouth (the upper line a little above it; the
lower one a little below it, to be exact) to the ear on each side. The
design tattooed upon the bride is not rectilinear, as was that tattooed
upon her forehead in childhood, but consists of upward-curving lines,
between every three or four of which is a row of marks resembling
chevrons. That is, this is the design most usually seen. In some cases,
however&mdash;and this is seen more frequently in the case of women
prominent in the tribal unit, therefore is perhaps an insignia of rank
or of honour&mdash;the design begins with three parallel curving lines,
a little space, then another line; immediately below which are two rows
of chevrons. The lower row of chevrons rests, as it were, upon another
line; again a little space, then four more parallel lines, the whole
design, when completed, being one of great elaboration.</p>

<p>As the bride is tattooed after the fashion described, so must
the bridegroom also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191"
id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> tattooed. But in his case the tattooing
must be done before marriage; this in order to show that he is a
successful warrior, and therefore entitled to enter upon the married
state. This insignia of honour and of dignity befitting a Benedict
consists of tattoo-marks on the chin&mdash;a series of straight lines,
a little longer than those pricked into the forehead in childhood. By
these presents know all men that the chin-tattooed young brave has at
least one head to his credit&mdash;though in these degenerate days it
may be only a head decapitated by his father on which his young hands
have been placed. In such a case, however, it is with humiliation and
with apologetic explanations that confession is made of the fact that
the valour was by proxy.</p>

<p>Among the Paiwan the successful warriors are tattooed on the
shoulders, the chest, or the arms; sometimes on all these parts of the
body; but less significance seems attached by them to tattoo-marking
than is the case among the Taiyal. Social custom seems to allow the
Paiwan greater latitude in the choice of design, which seems to be
regarded more as of purely ornamental character. It is, however,
possible that further research will show as definite a system regarding
tattoo-marking and its significance to exist among the Paiwan as among
the Taiyal.</p>

<p>Paiwan women are not tattooed on their bodies as the men of
the tribe are, or on their faces as are Taiyal women; but only
on the backs of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> hands&mdash;little series of lines that
approximate sometimes squares, sometimes circles. The women of the
Lu-chu islands have a similar custom. Whether or not there has been any
contact between the two peoples would be an interesting subject for
investigation.</p>

<p>The custom of circumcision does not seem to exist among any of
the Formosan tribes, either as a rite of puberty or of infancy.
Nor did I see any evidence while among them of finger mutilation,
such as exists among certain peoples in Africa; and also, I
believe, among some Australian tribes. Neither do young men pass
through the extremely painful initiation rites that are demanded
of the young “braves” of certain North American Indian
tribes&mdash;notably the Sioux&mdash;such as hanging suspended from a
rod which is passed through the flesh of the shoulders, walking over
live coals, or the like. The most painful rite to which either the
young man or the young woman is subjected is that of having the teeth
extracted. This is usually borne with stoical fortitude, and afterwards
the youth or maiden will proudly boast of the fact that the tongue can
be seen through the teeth, and will lose no opportunity of broadly
smiling to demonstrate the truth of the assertion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center">METHODS OF TRANSPORT</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>Ami Wheeled Vehicle Resembling Models found in Early Cyprian
Tombs&mdash;Boat-building and the Art of Navigation on the Decline.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> subject might be dismissed with
a word&mdash;so little is any method of transport less primitive
than that of human shoulders developed among the aboriginal
tribes&mdash;were it not for two facts which raise interesting
questions. One of these has to do with land transport; the other with
transport by water.</p>

<p>Regarding the former, the only tribe that uses any sort of wheeled
vehicle, or that knows anything of a beast of draught, is the Ami.
The vehicle of this tribe is a primitive two-wheeled cart, the
interesting point about it being that the solid wheels are fixed to
the axle, the latter revolving with each revolution of the wheels. In
fact, the construction of the cart causes it to resemble an enormous
harrow rather than any vehicle usually associated with transport.
The Ami tribes-people, however, are inordinately proud of this
invention, which they say was introduced among them by the “White
Fathers” (evidently the Dutch) of the “glorious long
ago.” This cart is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194"
id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> drawn by a “water-buffalo,”
a descendant of those said to have been brought to Formosa by
the Dutch.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The question of interest in connection with this vehicle is whether
or not the Dutch of the seventeenth century used carts of so primitive
a type as that now in use among the Ami. Is it not more probable that
when the carts introduced by the Dutch fell into decay, the Ami, in
their attempts at imitation of the original model, unconsciously
reproduced a form of vehicle used by man at the “dawn of
history?”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a
href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, the Ami cart produces a painful creaking, and a
sound that can be compared only to a series of <em>groans</em> when it is
drawn over the rough roads of the east coast. This, however, apparently
adds to its attractiveness in the eyes of its owners.</p>

<p>Whether or not the present-day cart represents the degeneration
of a more highly evolved type of vehicle once known to the Ami would
be difficult to assert with positiveness. As regards water<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
transport, however, it is almost certain that degeneration has taken
place among the Ami, as among the other Formosan tribes, both in
the craft of boat-building and in the understanding of navigation.
Tribal traditions among all the aborigines point to the fact that
their ancestors were skilful navigators and that they understood the
construction of boats capable of making long voyages. But the rafts
used for fishing at the present time by those tribes living on the east
coast could not be used for making even a short sea voyage. Nor could
the plank canoes also used for fishing which a few tribal units of the
Ami, living near Pinan, build&mdash;in obvious, though crude, imitation
of the Chinese fishing-junk&mdash;be used for navigation.</p>

<p>Of all the aboriginal tribes, the most skilful boat-builders
are the Yami, of Botel Tobago. Their boats, like their pottery,
resemble more those of the Papuans of the Solomon Islands than they
do those of the other Formosan tribes&mdash;this both in mode of
construction and in ornamentation. These boats are not dug-outs, but
are built from tree-trunks, smoothed and trimmed with adzes, lashed
together&mdash;through holes bored near the seams&mdash;with withes
of rattan. Prow and stern are rounded in graceful curves. The boats
present a picturesque and attractive appearance, but cannot be used for
making long voyages.</p>

<p>That the tribes living in the interior of the island should have
lost the art of navigation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> not surprising, as on the east
side of the mountain range&mdash;within which section the present
“savage territory” lies&mdash;there are no navigable
rivers, and in the mountains is only one lake, the beautiful
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Jitsugetsutan</i> (“Sun and Moon Lake”), so-called by the
Japanese.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a
href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> On this lake those
members of the Taiyal and Tsuou tribes who live near it paddle in their
dug-out canoes. These dug-outs, however, are of the most primitive
type, with open ends, obviously unfitted for seafaring. Even a storm
on the lake sends the canoes hurriedly paddling to shore. But the Ami
and the Yami, and also the Paiwan and Piyuma, have not the excuse that
applies to the tribes of the interior. Before these tribes lies the
open sea, over which their ancestors navigated. That they should have
lost the art of building and of navigating seaworthy craft is strange;
as strange as is the fact that many of the tribes have lost the art
of successful pottery-making, which according to tradition&mdash;and
also judging from the few ancient specimens preserved among the
Tsarisen&mdash;their ancestors seem to have possessed.</p>

<p>Whether the losing of these arts implies that the tribes since
they have been in Formosa have not had material as suitable for
making either seaworthy boats or uncrumbling pottery as they had
in the land whence they came, or whether<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> it implies that they
are an “ageing” people, a people who have lost their
“grip on life,” and have no longer either inventive ability
or mechanical skill, is a question which I shall not attempt to answer.
It is one which presents an interesting field for speculation and also
for further investigation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="intro">

<p>“Decadent” or “Primitive”&mdash;A Dream of
White Saviours from the West.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Whether the Formosan aborigines are a “decadent” people,
in the sense suggested in the last chapter, or whether they are
“primitive,” in the sense that they are at the beginning
of what would be a long racial life&mdash;a life with possibilities of
intellectual and social evolution&mdash;were they given opportunities
for the unhampered development of that life, is a question that
will probably never be answered. No race, whatever its virility or
potentiality for development, can long survive the military despotism
of a conquering people; especially when that conquering people is
consistently ruthless in the methods it adopts for crushing out the
racial individualities of the peoples whom it conquers.</p>

<p>It seems probable that under the dominance of the Japanese the
aborigines of Formosa will in a few decades, or, at the longest, in
a century or two, have ceased to exist as a people. Unless, indeed,
their dream of being rescued from the rule of both Chinese and Japanese
by “White Saviours from the West” ever come true; and
of this there seems no prospect at the present time. Nor has<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> the
white man&mdash;if one face the matter honestly&mdash;always proved
a “saviour” to the aboriginal races with whom he has
come into contact. As Bertrand Russell has recently intelligently
remarked (<cite>Manchester Guardian Weekly</cite>, Friday, December 2, 1921)
apropos of Japan’s policy in China: “Japan has merely
been copying Christian morals.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101"
id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The faith of the aboriginal Formosans, however, both in the power
and the goodness of the white man&mdash;and white woman&mdash;is
touching in the extreme. This does not happen to be due to the
efforts of present-day missionaries, since the efforts of the
latter are, as has been previously stated, confined to attempts at
Christianizing Chinese-Formosans (those who are usually known as
“Formosans”). The reverence among the aborigines for the
white race is the result of the Dutch occupation of three hundred years
ago&mdash;a tradition which has been handed down from generation to

<p>To “wonder furiously”&mdash;Better Government, or
Worse?&mdash;Comparison of Standards&mdash;A Conversation with
Aborigine Friends&mdash;The Question of Money&mdash;Tabus.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Looking</span> back over what I learned,
during the two years that I was in Formosa, of the manners and
customs&mdash;collectively speaking&mdash;of the aboriginal tribes,
and of the outlook on life of these <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Naturv&ouml;lker</i>, I am given to
“think furiously” along lines other than anthropological;
that is, along those that are sociological as well. Rather, perhaps, to
“wonder furiously.”</p>

<p>If it be true, as Dr. Tylor&mdash;in <cite>Primitive
Culture</cite>&mdash;points out, that “no human thought is so
primitive as to have lost bearing on our own thought, or so
ancient as to have broken connection with our own life,”
it opens up an interesting field for speculation. For one thing,
as to what would have been the line of social evolution of the
so-called superior races had they, like the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, continued to
regard the cutting off of an enemy head as meritorious rather than
otherwise. (Yet what is war between “civilized” races,
except head-hunting on a grand scale;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> only with accompanying
mangling and gassing and other horrors of which the island
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a
href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> knows nothing?)
And if, also like the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i>, prostitution had remained unknown, and
the breaking of a promise been regarded as so heinous a crime that
only the death of the one guilty of so foul a thing could save his
family and relatives and all who came into contact with him from being
contaminated by his own uncleanness.</p>

<p>What then? One wonders. What sort of civilization would have been
evolved, had culture progressed&mdash;as in Europe, for example, in
the matter of learning, of arts, and of sciences&mdash;yet had the
standards of right and wrong remained as they are with the primitive
folk among whom I spent two years, and if the fundamental conception of
government had remained the same&mdash;that of a matriarchal theocracy,
which is yet, in a sense, communistic.</p>

<p>Were they, too, matriarchal&mdash;the “tattooed and woaded,
winter-clad in skins” European forefathers of ours? It is a
dangerous thing to assume a unilineal line of evolution. Because
there are evidences of mother-right<a name="FNanchor_103_103"
id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> having been dominant in certain parts of
the world, or with certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202"
id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> peoples&mdash;and of this mother-right
still existing in a few isolated instances&mdash;it would be
rashly unwise to assume, as a few writers and speakers have done,
that the female of the species was once the dominant half of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i>. However, assuming for the sake of argument&mdash;or
of phantasy&mdash;that matriarchal government was once universal,
until the male learned that in the matter of governing the power
of brute force equalled, in efficacious results, that of summoning
spirits from the vasty deep on the part of priestess and sibyl,
or of ruling the tribe through aruspicy and the cries of birds;
or until he learned, perhaps, that brute force could even make
his own those priestly offices which had been the prerogative of
that sex once solely associated with the Mystic Force (by virtue
of that medium still regarded by primitive folk as sacred and
mysterious).<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a
href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Suppose, I say&mdash;and I underscore <em>suppose</em>&mdash;we assume
this mother-right&mdash;matri-potestal as well as matrilineal and
matri-local&mdash;once to have existed in Europe in as full force
as it still does in a few islands of the South Pacific; and, again,
suppose the male had never learned, or never chosen to apply, the
force of muscular suasion, what sort of Midsummer’s Night Dream
of a world should we have had? Would it have been an Eden&mdash;with
Adam kept very much in his place&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> sort of Golden Age,
such as many equal-suffrage advocates assert would be the outcome
of matriarchal rule; or would it have resulted in “confusion
worse confounded” (in this year of grace, 1922, is such a state
possible to conceive?), such as Weininger<a name="FNanchor_105_105"
id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and his school would assert could be the
only result of woman-rule? Or would this school concede that there
could be such a thing as a woman-ruled State? Would it not hold,
rather, that such an attempt could end only in anarchy?</p>

<p>Yet the realm which the women-chiefs and priestesses of Formosa
govern is the reverse of anarchic. Laws there are as the laws of the
Medes and Persians; or as those are supposed to have been. Every
act of daily life, personal as well as communal, is regulated by
law, and any infringement of this law is met with dire penalty.
This&mdash;incidentally&mdash;holds true with all primitive
peoples, patriarchal as well as matriarchal. Those who fancy
that a “return to nature”&mdash;meaning to primitive
conditions&mdash;would give licence either for lawlessness or for
the indulgence without restraint in individual preference, social
or political, reckon without knowledge of conditions actually
existing in primitive society. One shudders to think what would
have been Rousseau’s fate had he really “returned to
nature”&mdash;i.e. lived among the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Naturv&ouml;lker</i>&mdash;and
broken tabu of marriage or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> parenthood. For those who hold in
contempt established convention, or life regulated by law, primitive
society is not the place.</p>

<p>But to return to the question of gynarchic rule: All the women
of this particular island&mdash;or of that particular part of it
still under aboriginal control and hence matriarchal&mdash;are not
Sapphos or Katherines&mdash;are not even the primitive prototypes
of these illustrious ladies&mdash;any more than they are simpering
<em>Doras</em>,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a
href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> neurotics,
or nymphomaniacs. As George Eliot made one of her characters, in
speaking of her own sex, remark, “The Lord made ‘em
fools to match the men,” so one is inclined to ask, after
having seen the practical working of a gynocracy, if women were made
also good and bad&mdash;in the comprehensive inclusiveness of those
words&mdash;wise and foolish, to match the so-called sterner sex;
the sex which seems, however, in reality neither sterner nor more
bloodthirsty than the so-called gentler one; any more than it seems
a greater lover of abstract justice, which, according to one English
writer, “no woman understands.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107"
id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Which train of wondering brings us back to the original wonder
with which this chapter started: If our European forefathers had
ever, in the dim “once-upon-a-time” of long ago, the same
standards of right and wrong as the present-day <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">seban</i> of Formosa;
if they, too, were once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> matri-potestal&mdash;what would have
been the line of evolution that Europe would have followed had this
state of affairs continued, only gradually evolving, through letters
and arts, from savagery to so-called civilization? Should we have been
better governed or worse?</p>

<p>Or&mdash;another wonder intervenes. Would letters and arts have
ever developed under a matriarchy? Probably yes. Perhaps even to a
greater extent than has been the case during the long centuries of
patriarchal rule that have followed the possible once-upon-a-time
primitive matriarchates of antiquity. For even recognizing that the
creative faculty&mdash;artistic and inventive&mdash;is the heritage
of man rather than of woman, has it not, within historic times, in
civilized countries, been ever under queen rulership that letters
and art have flourished? Perhaps an unrecognized, sublimated form of
sex-instinct&mdash;or so a certain school of psycho-analysts would
argue&mdash;that has spurred masculine creative genius to its highest
point; as it spurred, apparently, the venturous spirit of the great
explorers, certainly of the Elizabethan age; and as, in a later age in
England, it spurred those who dreamed of world conquest in the name
of the “Great Good Queen.” Has personal idolatry rendered
to a king ever equalled that rendered to a queen, whether by soldier
or poet, artist or farm-labourer? The sex instinct here, as in other
fields, has played its part, and in this particular field usually
for good rather than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> evil. Perhaps no more Sapphos would have
arisen under the rule of women than of men; but it seems not improbable
that more men poets might have arisen, worthily and lustily to sing the
praises of queens.</p>

<p>And the governing&mdash;worse governed or better under theocratic
queens than under kings or under mobs? Not worse, I think. Executive
ability seems woman’s in surprising degree where she has had the
opportunity to exercise it; often where the exercise of it has been
unrecognized, because attributed to the male&mdash;her man&mdash;who
stood before the world, or who sat upon the throne.</p>

<p>As executive and ruler in miniature&mdash;executive in the
household and ruler over the children, since house, in any form,
has existed or maternal responsibility, however elementary, been
recognized&mdash;executive ability seems to have been developed
in women; just as through child-bearing and rearing&mdash;or
psycho-physical potentiality for this&mdash;intellectual creative
faculty has, with the normal woman, remained dormant.</p>

<p>So much for wondering over possible might-have-beens in connection
with matriarchal government, if this system in some supposititious
long-ago ever existed in Europe.</p>

<p>As for the general standards of right and wrong&mdash;standards as
they exist among the aborigines of Formosa, compared with standards
which exist to-day in Europe: Would it be more agreeable to be in
danger of losing one’s head, if<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> one went for a sunset
stroll and ventured too near enemy territory&mdash;provided oneself
were not the first to secure the enemy head&mdash;yet to know that
a word once given, by friend or enemy, would never be broken; that
no lock would be needed to guard one’s possessions; that
life-insurance had not to be taken into consideration, because, in case
of one’s untimely demise, one’s wife and children would,
as a matter of course, be given equal provender with the other members
of the community; that not only was no special plea for mercy needed
for “fatherless children and widows,” but that, as a matter
of fact, these usually fared somewhat better than other members of the
community, because the widow generally became a priestess, and as such
wielded greater power and influence in the community than a mere wife
could do?</p>

<p>Also to know that fire-insurance might equally be left out of
the reckoning, as in case one’s house were destroyed by fire,
all one’s neighbours could be relied upon to build one a new
house.</p>

<p>Would it be more agreeable to know that battle, murder, and sudden
death were ever-present possibilities, if one happened to be a man
and a warrior (and to be one meant being the other), yet to know
that while life lasted it would ever be a merry one; that if by
chance old age or illness overtook one, one would be cared for, not
as a matter of charity, but again&mdash;as in the case of widows and
orphans&mdash;as a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208"
id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> of course; or to cower before what old
age and illness and out-of-work days mean for the poverty-stricken in
present-day civilization?</p>

<p>To live knowing that death sudden, yet swift and comparatively
painless, might one day be one’s portion&mdash;or the portion
of one’s husband&mdash;yet ever to be certain, while one lived,
of a home as good as that of any member of the people to whom one
belonged; of clothing and fuel and food in abundance; or to live as the
poor in the great cities of Christian civilization live, and to die
as they die; to cry not only for bread where there is no bread, but
for work where there is no work; in decrepit old age and illness to
be cared for by the community, if at all, as a matter of contemptuous
pity,&mdash;which were preferable?</p>

<p>I tried once to explain something of economic conditions in the
white man’s world, and in that of modern Japan, to one of my
Formosan aborigine friends. The idea that one should receive more than
another, unless that other had by misconduct forfeited his share, was
as difficult for my friend to understand as it was that a man could
not work who wanted to work, or that there should not be food enough
for all. That it was held to be a matter of shame to be helped by the
community when one was too old or too ill to work was incomprehensible;
as incomprehensible as was the question of prostitution. “But
women who live so, how can they have strong sons and daughters?”
he asked. “And how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"
id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> can they make good priestesses to the
people?” an old priestess who was standing by asked. “Such
women destroy faith,” she added, “not build it up for the
guidance of men.”</p>

<p>I thought of the Inari temples&mdash;those devoted to the worship
of the Fox-god&mdash;and of the votaries of these temples, in Japan. I
thought of the stories of the temples of Babylon, of Egypt, of certain
of those in ancient Greece&mdash;all these had represented mighty
civilizations; the votaries of the Fox-god temples belong to a nation
that is to-day one of the great world-powers; while the old Formosan
woman was only a savage. How could she know anything of the refinements
of civilization, or of what civilization demands?</p>

<p>But those ancient civilizations, I reflected&mdash;they were
“heathen”; even present-day Japan is “heathen.”
As a member of a race that is supposed to uphold Christian civilization
and to convert heathen peoples to its tenets, there was momentary
unction in this thought. Then, as the old man and old woman stood
looking up at me, with inquiring, wrinkled faces, awaiting an answer
to questions that would solve the problem that was puzzling them,
there flashed across my mind the memory of a Christian temple, in
a great Christian capital, which it was the fashion of the more
fashionable stratum of the painted ladies of the city to attend, and
where&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210"
id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But no, they were not priestesses; only devotees who exchanged
glances with the male devotees, and who after the services spoke
with the latter, doubtless for the “upbuilding of their
faith.”</p>

<p>And as for the question of the old man; how could women who lived so
have strong sons and daughters? I thought of all the painted women of
all the great cities of the world&mdash;those flaunting their silks and
furs and jewels under the electric glare of the great thoroughfares,
inviting with smiles and glances; and those others, shivering,
wrapping their rags about them in dark corners, croaking, cackling,
and clutching desperately, hoping to earn, in an ancient profession of
civilization, enough to buy food and drink sufficient to keep life a
little longer in unclean, diseased bodies. These women had no children;
but I thought of their male companions; some their victims; some who
had victimized and had started certain of the painted ones in their
profession; some merely the boon companions of an hour. And I thought
of hospitals I had visited; of operations that I had witnessed on the
wives of the men who had “settled down after sowing a few wild
oats”&mdash;years of agony in one life as a vicarious atonement
for perhaps one night of wine and laughter and song in the life of
another. And I thought of children I had seen, and of grandchildren....
It made it a little difficult to explain clearly, to the old man
and the old woman, the benefits of a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> system inextricably
interwoven with civilization, ancient and modern; and the reason
why this system lent a delicate zest to the art of civilized
living. And part of my wonder to-day is: Supposing, <em>supposing</em>,
this art&mdash;this profession&mdash;had never been introduced into
society&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Almost as difficult to answer as was the question of the reason why
of money-taking in exchange for love were other questions put to me by
aboriginal friends in connection with money. Why money at all? What
were the benefits of this “recognized medium of exchange,”
and of the great banking systems, which are part of the economic
fabric of every civilization of the world. I gave a few coins to some
men and women of the Yami tribe; they began to beat them out into
thin plates to add to their helmets. I gave some to the Ami people;
they drilled holes in them and fastened them, as ornamental buttons,
to their blankets. Those that I gave to the Paiwan they inserted in
holes in their ears&mdash;all except one young warrior who set his
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">ni-ju-sen</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a
href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> piece among
the boars’ tusks that ornamented his cap. The Taiyal
priestess to whom I gave a <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">go-ju-sen</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109"
id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a> piece regarded it with reverence, and
carefully wrapped it in a banana-leaf. A short time afterwards
I saw her, sitting by the bedside of a patient, balancing the
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">go-ju-sen</i> on a bamboo-rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> gripped between her knees; the small
stone generally used on such occasions&mdash;mentioned in the chapter
<span class="smcap">Illness and Death</span>&mdash;having been replaced
by the shining silver coin.</p>

<p>The Taiyal seemed to think that some particularly powerful
<i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> was connected with silver coins. Perhaps the “White
Fathers,” and also the Chinese and Japanese, used these shining
pieces to draw down the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> of long-departed ancestors; hence had
they waxed mighty. That such <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> pieces might be used as media of
exchange between different tribes, when these were not actively at war
with each other&mdash;this was comprehensible; but that such should be
needed, or conceivably ever used, between members of the same tribe or
nation&mdash;this was not comprehensible. “Surely man does not
kill meat for himself alone, when his brothers, too, are hungry; nor
does a woman grow millet for her own children alone, when the children
of other women are crying for food.”</p>

<p>Nor could I ever quite make my savage friends realize the
blessings of civilization in the matters of the economic system, any
more than of the social. They could only comprehend that among the
enlightened ones of the world it was somehow tabu for one man to
have as many shining pieces as another, or as much meat and drink,
as good a house to shelter him from the wind, or as much fuel to
make fire in the rainy season, as another, that somehow the shining
<i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> pieces brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> these blessings. But just why was it
tabu for one man to have more than another? They were much puzzled,
until at last one Taiyal man suggested that no doubt the White
God-descended Ones knew, in their wisdom, which of their brothers were
most worthy, most noble and holy; and to the most holy was awarded the
largest share of the <i lang="tay" xml:lang="tay">Ottofu</i> pieces.</p>

<p>And still I am wondering what if the speculations of my savage
friends had been correct&mdash;what sort of a Europe should I be living
in to-day? How would it contrast with the Europe that is?</p>

<p>When my friends learned of the tabu connected with the shining
pieces, they wished to hear more of the tabus of the Great Ones. Were
these the same as their own: tabus that surrounded young men and
maidens, which prevented the latter from hearing an indelicate word
or seeing a coarse gesture, that prevented the marriage of too near
relations, that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I hurried to assent, “among the better
classes all these tabus are observed.”</p>

<p>“But,” my interlocutors interrupted, “what is
meant by classes, and, if there is more than one class among the same
people, why should the young girls of one class be protected more than
those of another?”</p>

<p>Again their intelligence failed to grasp my attempts at a
logical explanation. But a priestess pressed for further knowledge
on the subject of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214"
id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> white man’s&mdash;and especially
the white woman’s&mdash;tabus. Was it tabu for a husband to
be either brutal to his wife&mdash;&mdash; “Yes, among the
better&mdash;&mdash;” I began. But the priestess hurried
on: “or indelicate in his attentions to her; was she, his
wife&mdash;as regards marital relations&mdash;to be tabu to him
altogether before the birth of her children, and for some time
afterwards? Was a disloyal husband himself so tabu that, even in the
tribes where he was not beheaded or stoned to death, no self-respecting
member of the community&mdash;either man or woman&mdash;would speak to
him or supply him with food; so that he had to flee to the woods and
live as an outcast?”</p>

<p>I tried to explain that it was difficult to know; one could not be
sure, for there were some points on which neither men nor women always
told the exact truth.</p>

<p>“But not to tell the truth!” my friends cried in chorus.
“Surely the curses of their ancestors are on those who do not
speak the truth!”</p>

<p>And I thought, or tried to think, of a civilization&mdash;white
or yellow&mdash;in which men and women spoke always the truth, with
nothing added, nothing suppressed; where “yea” meant
always <em>yea</em>, and “nay,” <em>nay</em>; where the realization that
anything more “cometh of evil” was put into practice;
consequently the anything more left unsaid. And still I am trying
to think what civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> under these conditions would mean.
Civilization&mdash;I am wondering.</p>

<p>Since my sojourn among the men and women who live in the mountains
of Formosa that word&mdash;civilization&mdash;has had a new meaning;
been a new source of wonder to me.</p>

<p class="noindent">Old plated ware has, by reason of its artistic
excellence and its technique, deservedly won favour with collectors.
The art of making plated ware, which originated at Sheffield (hence
the name “Sheffield plate”), was continued at Birmingham
and London, where a considerable amount of “old Sheffield
plate” was made, in the manner of its first inventors, by
welding sheets of silver upon copper. The manufacture lasted roughly
a hundred years. Its best period was from 1776 (American Declaration
of Independence) to 1830 (Accession of William IV). The author
shows reasons why this old Sheffield plate should be collected,
and the volume is illustrated with many examples giving various
styles and the development of the art, together with makers’
marks. Candlesticks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232"
id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> candelabra, tea-caddies, sugar-baskets,
salt-cellars, tea-pots, coffee-pots, salvers, spoons, and many other
articles shown and described in the volume indicate the exquisite
craftsmanship of the best period. The work stands as a companion volume
to the author’s “Chats on Old Silver,” the standard
practical guide to old English silver collecting.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Every collector knows the name of Mr. Arthur
Hayden, and knows him for a wise counsellor. Upon old furniture, old
china, old pottery, and old prints there is no more knowing judge in
the country; and in his latest volume he supplies a notable need, in
the shape of a vade-mecum exploring some of the nondescript and little
traversed bye-paths of the collector. There was never a time when the
amateur of the antique stood more in need of a competent guide.... The
man who wishes to avoid the pitfalls of the fraudulent will find much
salutary advice in Mr. Hayden’s gossipy pages. There are chests,
for example, a fruitful field for reproduction. Mr. Hayden gives
photographs of many exquisite examples. There is a marriage coffer
of the sixteenth century, decorated with carved figures of Cupid and
Hymen, a fine Gothic chest of the fifteenth century, with rich foliated
decorations; and a superb livery cupboard from Haddon Hall. From
Flanders come steel coffers, with a lock of four bolts, the heavy sides
strongly braized together. Then there are snuffers, with and without
trays, tinder-boxes, snuff graters, and metal tobacco stoppers. The
most fascinating designs are shown, with squirrels, dogs, and quaint
human figures at the summit. Fans and playing-cards provide another
attractive section.</p>

collector’s passion, because of the grace of the article and
its beauty as a display. Mr. Hayden shows a particularly beautiful
one, with designs after Fragonard, the sticks of ivory with jewelled
studs. Then there are watch-stands, a little baroque in design, and
table-bells, some of them shaped as female figures with spreading
skirts, old toys and picture-books, and, of course, cradles, of which
every English farm-house once boasted its local variety. Altogether
the book abounds in inviting pictures and curious information, and is
certain of a large, appreciative public.”</p>

<p class="ph2">THE ADVANCE OF SOUTH AMERICA</p>

<p class="noindent center">A FEW NOTES ON SOME INTERESTING BOOKS DEALING
WITH THE PAST HISTORY, PRESENT AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES OF THE GREAT
CONTINENT</p>

<p class="noindent">When in 1906 Mr. Fisher Unwin commissioned the
late Major Martin Hume to prepare a series of volumes by experts on
the South American Republics, but little interest had been taken in
the country as a possible field for commercial development. The chief
reasons for this were ignorance as to the trade conditions and the
varied resources of the country, and the general unrest and instability
of most of the governments. With the coming of the South American
Series of handbooks the financial world began to realize the importance
of the country, and, with more settled conditions, began in earnest
to develop the remarkable natural resources which awaited outside
enterprise. Undoubtedly the most informative books on the various
Republics are those included in <span class="smcap">The South American
Series</span>, each of which is the work of a recognized authority on
his subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“The output of books upon Latin America has
in recent years been very large, a proof doubtless of the increasing
interest that is felt in the subject. Of these the ‘South
American Series’ is the most noteworthy.”</p>

<p class="right"><cite>The Times.</cite></p>

<p class="noindent">“When the ‘South American Series’
is completed, those who take interest in Latin-American affairs will
have an invaluable encyclop&aelig;dia at their disposal.”</p>

speaking, he may be said to have started from Panama, wandered through
Colombia, spending some time at Bogota, and then going on to Ecuador,
of which Quito is the centre. Next he traversed the fascinating country
of the Incas, from the borders of which he entered Bolivia, going
right across that country till he approached Brazil. He passed through

<p class="noindent">This volume represents a series of almost continuous
explorations hardly ever paralleled in the huge areas

of those who accompanied Colonel Roosevelt on
his famous South American expedition&mdash;and his first object
in his wanderings over 150,000 miles of territory was the
observation of wild life; but hardly second was that of
exploration. The result is a wonderfully informative,
impressive and often thrilling narrative in which savage
peoples and all but unknown animals largely figure, which
forms an infinitely readable book and one of rare value
for geographers, naturalists and other scientific men.</p>

the sun-bathed countries of Latin-America. Mr. Atkin’s verses

recall to “old-timers” bygone memories of days spent in the
land of the Coconut Tree.</p>

<p class="noindent">A complete history of the Belgian nation from its
origins to its present situation has not yet been published in this
country. Up till now Belgian history has only been treated as a side
issue in works concerned with the Belgian art, Belgian literature or
social conditions. Besides, there has been some doubt with regard
to the date at which such a history ought to begin, and a good many
writers have limited themselves to the modern history of Belgium
because they did not see in olden times sufficient evidence of Belgian
unity. According to the modern school of Belgian historians, however,
this unity, founded on common traditions and common interests, has
asserted itself again and again through the various periods of history
in spite of invasion, foreign domination and the various trials
experienced by the country. The history of the Belgian nation appears
to the modern mind as a slow development of one nationality constituted
by two races speaking two different languages but bound together by
geographical, economic and cultural conditions. In view of the recent
proof Belgium has given of her patriotism during the world-war, this
impartial enquiry into her origins may prove interesting to British
readers. Every opportunity has been taken to insist on the frequent
relationships between the Belgian provinces and Great Britain from
the early middle ages to the present time, and to show the way in
which both countries were affected by them. Written by one of the most
distinguished Belgian writers, who has made a specialty of his subject,
this work will be one of the most brilliant and informing contributions
in “The Story of the Nations.<span class="pagenum"><a

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It is but fair
to add, however, that among tribes with whom the matrilocal custom
exists, the position of the woman is apt to be better than among
those that are patrilocal. This particularly as far as the treatment
of the wife is concerned. The husband is regarded always more or
less as a visitor&mdash;an “auslander”&mdash;among his
wife’s people; one over whom the influence of his father-in-law
and brothers-in-law has a chastening effect. In matrilocal tribes
the real power lies usually in the hands of the father and the elder
brother of the wife, who have absolute authority over her and over her
children.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Formosa is only
225 miles (approximately) north of Cape Engano, the northernmost point
of the Philippine Islands, of which Manila is the capital.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Some Chinese
scholars maintain that Terrace Bay (i.e. a bay surrounded by terraces)
is a more accurate translation than Terrace Beach.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> There is some
difference of opinion as to the origin of the name. Shinji Ishii,
the Japanese writer, suggests that the Chinese name, Taiwan, is a
corruption of <em>Paiwan</em>, the name of one of the aboriginal tribes of the
island. In this connection it must be remembered that the Japanese,
generally speaking, are prone to deny to the Chinese capacity for
poetic conception, or appreciation of beauty. I, however, who have
lived among the Chinese, and know their genuine appreciation of the
beautiful in nature, and their habit of fixing the poetic concept of a
moment by crystallizing it in a word or phrase, think “Terrace
Beach” or “Terrace Bay” the more probable meaning of
<em>Taiwan</em>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I had gone to

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a

I was, when in Kyoto, devoting my attention chiefly to the study of
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Shin-shu</i> (not to be confounded with Shinto)&mdash;one of the many
sects into which Mahayana Buddhism is now divided, the sect associated
with the two great Hongwanji temples of Kyoto&mdash;and comparing these
teachings with those of <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Zen-shu</i>, another sect of Mahayana Buddhism,
which I had previously studied in a Zen monastery in Kamakura.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> As
a teacher in this school I ranked as a “two-button”
official (<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sōninkan</i>) of the Japanese Government, and
thus technically entitled to wear two buttons on the sleeve of
my coat, and to carry a short sword with a white handle. The
Director of the school, the Head Master and the heads of one or
two departments and the other “foreign” teachers were
also “two-button” officials. The majority of the
teachers were “one-button” officials (<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">hanninkan</i>),
entitled to wear only one button on the sleeve of their coats
and to carry a black-handled sword. The “two-button”
officials were “invited”&mdash;i.e. practically
commanded&mdash;to attend official government banquets and similar
functions, and to meet visiting princes and other notables from the
“mother-country.” The “one-button” officials
escaped these honours.</p></div>

for the daughters of Japanese officials has also been established
in Taihoku; but it is an interesting commentary upon the position
of women in Japan, even at the present time, that while several
“foreign” (English and American) teachers are engaged
for the boys’ school, no “foreign” teacher is
employed for the girls’ school. That would be “too
expensive for a girls’ school,” the Japanese say. Also,
while the curriculum of the two schools is&mdash;with the exception
of English&mdash;practically the same, yet the boys’ school is
called a Middle School (Chu Gakkō), because the boys are expected
to go later to a Higher School, for the completion of their education;
while the girls’ school is called a Higher School (Kōtō
Gakkō) because the education of girls is supposed to be completed
with the completion of the course in this school.</p></div>

recent change of view-point on the part of the Japanese regarding
Koksinga throws an interesting side-light on the psychology of that
race. Previous to 1895 the name of Koksinga was in Japan held up
to universal execration. He had been a “villainous Chinese
pirate; one who had behaved in Taiwan with the usual cruelty of his
race” (i.e. the Chinese). Since 1895 when the Japanese came into
control of Formosa, and, in turn, dispossessed the Chinese, it has
been discovered “in old Japanese records” that Koksinga
had a Japanese mother. Therefore he was Japanese&mdash;and a hero.
Temples have recently been erected in honour of this “Japanese
hero” by the Japanese, in several places in Formosa. To one
who knows how strictly patrilineal the Japanese are&mdash;how
little relationship through the line of the mother is usually
considered&mdash;“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est &agrave; rire</i>”!</p></div>

Japanese, of even the more educated classes&mdash;teachers and

“came from heaven.” The ancestors of all other races they
consider to have been earth-born. On this assumption they base their
conception of the superiority of the Japanese race to all other races.
There is a mountain in the southern part of Japan, near Kagoshima,
to which the Japanese point as the actual spot on which their first
ancestors alighted when they descended from heaven.</p></div>

Brockhaus, <cite>Konversationslexikon</cite>: “Dido oder Elissa, die
sagenhafte Gr&uuml;nderin von Karthago, war eine Tochter des tyrischen
K&ouml;nigs Mutto und die Gemahlin von dessen Bruder Sicharbas (bei
Virgil Sich&auml;us) einem Priester des Melkart. Ihr Bruder t&ouml;tete
ihren Gemahl, worauf Dido mit dessen Sch&auml;tzen, begleitet von
vielen Tyriern, entfloh, um einen neuen Wohnsitz zu suchen. Sie landete
in Afrika, unweit der schon bestehenden ph&ouml;nizischen Pflanzstadt
Ityke (Utika) und baute auf dem den Eingeborenen abgekauften Boden
eine Burg Byrsa (das Fell). Die Bedeutung dieses Wortes wurde durch
die Sage so erkl&auml;rt: Dido habe so viel Land gekauft, wie mit
einer Rindshaut belegt werden k&ouml;nne, dann aber listig die Haut in
d&uuml;nne Streifen geschnitten und damit einen weiten Raum umgrenzt.
An die Burg schloss sich hierauf die Stadt Karthago an. Hier ward Dido
nach ihrem Tode, den sie sich selbst auf dem Scheiterhaufen gab, um
dem Begehren des Nachbark&ouml;nigs Hiarbas (Jarbas) nach ihrer Hand
zu entgehen, g&ouml;ttlich verehrt, wie denn ihre mythische Gestalt
offenbar derjenigen der grossen weiblichen Gottheit der Semiten
entspricht, welche auch den Namen Dido f&uuml;hrte. Virgil l&auml;sst,
wie es schon N&auml;vius getan, den &Auml;neas zur Dido kommen und
giebt dessen Untreue als die Ursache ihres Todes an.”</p>

<p>Aus Weber, <cite>Weltgeschichte</cite>: “Die Sage von der Ochsenhaut
bei Gr&uuml;ndung der Stadt (Karthago) ist bezeichnend f&uuml;r den

Altertum ber&uuml;hmt war.”</p>

days of the Chinese over-lordship of the island there were several
British consulates in Formosa; one in Takao, the southern port of the
island, and one in Anping, the harbour on the west coast, as well as
the one in Keelung. Since Formosa has been a part of the Japanese
Empire, however, British trade with the island has steadily declined.
No encouragement&mdash;in fact, every discouragement&mdash;is given
it by the present masters of the island; hence there are no longer
consulates at either Takao or Anping, and the great houses formerly
occupied by the consuls, which were centres of both social and business
activity in the British colonies at Takao and Anping, respectively, are
now falling into decay, occupied only by bats, snakes, and homeless
Chinese-Formosan beggars.</p></div>

under “conditions of civilization,” however, eugenists
hold that more male infants than female are born, but fewer reach
maturity. Among primitive peoples the disproportion seems greater;
that is, except among those tribes where the women are deliberately
fattened&mdash;supposedly to enhance their beauty&mdash;as is the
case with certain of the African tribes; or except among those where
polygamy exists, which Frazer suggests may tend to increase the
proportion of females (see <cite>Totemism and Exogamy</cite>, vol. i.).</p></div>

attitude of reverencing the priestesses as rain-destroyers is in
curious contrast with that of certain African tribes (e.g. the Dinkas
and Shilluks, according to Dr. Seligman), with whom the king&mdash;who
is also chief priest&mdash;is called “rain-maker”; this
difference of point of view of course being due to difference of
climatic conditions.</p></div>

a hut erected on piles, some twenty feet above ground. In this

group must spend the first five days and nights after marriage. The
house is exorcised by the priestesses before the entrance of the bridal

is possible, however, that if Mr. Russell had been in Korea in
March 1919, and had seen the hideous cruelty practised at that
time&mdash;cruelty which took the form of peculiarly ingenious and
diabolical modes of torture on the part of Japanese officialdom
towards unarmed Koreans, women and children as well as men&mdash;he
might have modified his statement to the extent of saying that
present-day Japan is copying Christian morals of the age of the
Inquisition. That Japan is not a “Christian country”
has no bearing on the question, since Buddhism, quite as much as
Christianity, enjoins forbearance and gentleness, and stresses&mdash;as
its key-note&mdash;“harmlessness.” But the teachings of
Gautama, like those of Christ, have little effect upon “the
direction taken by the criminal tendencies,” as Mr. Russell puts
it, of the nominal followers of these teachings&mdash;in Orient or
Occident.</p></div>

torture is applied to the vanquished enemy before death releases him
from suffering.</p></div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
